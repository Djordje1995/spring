00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:02,812
<v Instructor>In this video, we're going to get an</v>

2
00:00:02,812 --> 00:00:04,729
overview of Spring MVC.

3
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:10,133
So what is Spring MVC?

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,549
Well, basically, it's a framework for building web

5
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,480
applications in Java.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,573
As the name suggests, it's based on the

7
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:19,900
Model-View-Controller design pattern.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,452
And also, the nice thing about it is that it leverages

9
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,392
the features of the Core Spring Framework, so you can

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,565
leverage all of your inversion of control,

11
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,021
and dependency of injection.

12
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,727
So everything that you've learned in the class so far

13
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:34,894
you'll be able to apply in Spring MVC.

14
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:40,114
Okay, so here's a big picture here of the MVC framework,

15
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:43,109
and the process flow and how it works.

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,695
So basically you have an incoming request coming from

17
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,620
the browser, it'll encounter the Spring MVC

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,341
front controller.

19
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,042
This person will actually delegate the request off to a

20
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,395
controller code.

21
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:57,252
This controller code is code that you create that contains

22
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,770
your business logic.

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,509
You basically create a model, and you send the model back

24
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:04,297
to the front controller, and then the front controller,

25
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,968
will pass that model over to your view template.

26
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:10,177
So your view template is basically like a html page,

27
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:13,570
or a JSP page that will take that data, and then render

28
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,751
a response to the browser.

29
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,746
So that's kind of the big picture of the MVC framework.

30
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,096
In following videos, I'll kind of break this down,

31
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:25,020
and I'll go into more details on each step of the process.

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,181
But anyway, this is a big picture here on how Spring MVC

33
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:30,431
will process a web request.

34
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:36,180
Alright, so what are the benefits of using Spring MVC?

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,105
Well it's basically Spring's way of building

36
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,868
web apps using Java.

37
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:44,138
So basically you can leverage a set of reusable UI

38
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:46,268
components, and these are available in the form of

39
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:48,806
Spring JSP custom tags.

40
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,980
You can also manage your application state for web requests

41
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,389
for session tracking, or application tracking,

42
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,203
and you can also process your form data, so you can also

43
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:01,066
perform validation on the form data, conversion,

44
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,606
so on and so forth.

45
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:06,088
And finally, Spring MVC has a very flexible configuration

46
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,797
for the view layers, so you're not limited to only using

47
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,686
JSP, you can use other view layers like Thymeleaf,

48
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:14,686
Velocity, or FreeMarker.

49
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:19,616
And I'll talk about this in some of the following videos.

50
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,648
Alright, now as far as documentation, there's a lot of

51
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,493
good documentation available.

52
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:27,606
Here's the official documentation from Spring.

53
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,132
You can go to this website I have here,

54
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:32,108
luv2code.com/spring-mvc-docs.

55
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,434
This will basically just redirect you to the official

56
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,606
documentation at the Spring website.

57
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,870
So they have a very good write up on how the framework

58
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,646
works, details, and pretty much everything you need to know

59
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,281
is available in that documentation.

60
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,804
That's the actually Spring reference manual.

61
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,033
And if you wanted to have more information about Spring,

62
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,256
well there's plenty of books online.

63
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,203
So you can simply go to Amazon, you can type in the word

64
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:59,803
Spring MVC and do a search, and you'll have a lot of good

65
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:02,017
hits out there, so a lot of good books out there.

66
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:05,006
Go ahead and read the reviews, see which ones work for you,

67
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,777
and you can proceed accordingly.

68
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:09,641
But a lot of information's available at Amazon, and also

69
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,147
there's a lot of free websites that have Spring MVC

70
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,397
tutorials, too.

71
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,412
Alright, so that was just a quick overview of Spring MVC.

72
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:19,701
In the following videos I'll go into some details,

73
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,741
I'll give you a quick behind-the-scenes tour of Spring MVC,

74
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,964
and then we'll set up our development environment,

75
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,222
and then we'll start writing some code.

76
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:30,055
So I'll see you in the next video.
