00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,284
<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna</v>

2
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:06,345
talk about our development environment setup.

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,615
So, as a checkpoint, these are three items

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:12,929
that you're gonna need for your development environment.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,703
So, so far you should have already installed

6
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:19,870
Tomcat, Eclipse, and also Connected Eclipse to Tomcat.

7
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:22,750
You need to have this setup

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,215
and configured before you can proceed.

9
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,359
This is all covered in previous videos,

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,998
so if you haven't done this yet,

11
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:31,039
please go back to those videos

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,598
and get it configured accordingly.

13
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:35,918
Now, there's some additional things

14
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:37,502
that we're gonna need to do.

15
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:40,750
The first item is downloading Spring MVC source code

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,990
that's specific for this training class.

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,998
I have some sample files that you'll use

18
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,950
to kind of get started with some of the configuration.

19
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,375
And then also, what we're gonna do is,

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,190
we're gonna download the latest Spring JAR files

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,999
from the Spring websites.

22
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,286
There were some recent updates to Spring,

23
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:59,854
and I want to take advantage of those new features

24
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:02,521
and cover it here in the course.
