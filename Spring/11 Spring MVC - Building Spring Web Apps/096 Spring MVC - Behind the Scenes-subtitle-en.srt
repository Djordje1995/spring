00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:02,128
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:04,383
I'm gonna give you a behind the scenes tour

3
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:05,550
of Spring MVC.

4
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:12,551
What are the components of a Spring MVC application?

5
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:14,551
Basically it's a collection of web pages

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,316
to layout your UI components.

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,799
It's also a collection of Spring beans,

8
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,323
for controlling, handling services,

9
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:22,567
and so on.

10
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,035
And then finally you have your Spring configuration.

11
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,847
You can choose XML, Annotations, or pure Java.

12
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:31,008
And those are kinda the main components

13
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,341
of a Spring MVC application.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,711 line:15% 
Now, how does Spring MVC work behind the scenes?

15
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,351 line:15% 
In a previous video I showed you this

16
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:41,799 line:15% 
little diagram here of the process model.

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,353 line:15% 
What I wanna do is actually take this

18
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:45,926 line:15% 
little process model and kind of break it down,

19
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,757 line:15% 
and kinda dig into it a little bit,

20
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,413 line:15% 
and kinda go step-by-step.

21
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,319 line:15% 
Do a little deep dive on how the

22
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,402 line:15% 
whole process flow works.

23
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,845 line:15% 
Everything starts off with that first

24
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:00,142 line:15% 
incoming request and it encounters something

25
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:01,694 line:15% 
called a front controller.

26
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,925 line:15% 
So the front controller is known as

27
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,851 line:15% 
the dispatcher servelet.

28
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,848 line:15% 
This front controller's actually part

29
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,512 line:15% 
of the Spring framework.

30
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:13,094 line:15% 
It's already developed by the Spring development team

31
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:15,067 line:15% 
so you don't have to create this.

32
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,987 line:15% 
This is part of the Spring jar files

33
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:17,828 line:15% 
that you download,

34
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,955 line:15% 
so it's given to you for free.

35
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:21,673 line:15% 
So out of the box you have his front controller.

36
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,051 line:15% 
What this front controller will do

37
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,172 line:15% 
is it will actually delegate the request

38
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,694 line:15% 
to some other objects or items

39
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:29,828 line:15% 
here in our system.

40
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:33,089 line:15% 
As a developer, you will create

41
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:36,756 line:15% 
the model, the view, and the controller MVC.

42
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,044 line:15% 
So the model objects are in orange.

43
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:43,394 line:15% 
The model objects contain data.

44
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,687 line:15% 
The view templates,

45
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,786 line:15% 
that are in dark green,

46
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:48,184 line:15% 
that's your actual JSP page,

47
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:50,051 line:15% 
or your view page to actually

48
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,599 line:15% 
render the data.

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,483 line:15% 
And then C,

50
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,376 line:15% 
the controller classes that's in yellow,

51
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,346 line:15% 
that's your actual business logic

52
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,391 line:15% 
or your processing logic.

53
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:00,232 line:15% 
Coming up next, I'll actually talk about

54
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:03,482 line:15% 
each one of these components in detail.

55
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:07,300 line:15% 
Let's start with controller.

56
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,311 line:15% 
So when the front controller has a request,

57
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,517 line:15% 
it delegates the request to the controller.

58
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,562 line:15% 
That's in yellow.

59
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:17,050 line:15% 
The controller is the code that you will actually create.

60
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,999 line:15% 
Basically in this controller,

61
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,194 line:15% 
this contains your business logic.

62
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:23,181 line:15% 
So this is where you'll handle the request

63
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,057 line:15% 
where you'll maybe read some form data

64
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,232 line:15% 
then you'll take this data

65
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:27,820 line:15% 
and store it or retrieve it.

66
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,856 line:15% 
You may store it into a database or

67
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,239 line:15% 
retrieve information from a web service.

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,185 line:15% 
Basically, once you have your data

69
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,320 line:15% 
and you're using it,

70
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,655 line:15% 
then you can take that data

71
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,211 line:15% 
and place it into the model.

72
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:40,496 line:15% 
So the model is just a container for your data

73
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,538 line:15% 
and then you pass it back to the appropriate

74
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,804 line:15% 
view template.

75
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,631 line:15% 
So again, your controller,

76
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:46,932 line:15% 
code that you create,

77
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,804 line:15% 
contains your business logic,

78
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,387 line:15% 
and it handles the web request.

79
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,009 line:15% 
So let's talk about the model.

80
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,353 line:15% 
As I mentioned earlier,

81
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,416 line:15% 
the model contains your data.

82
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,960 line:15% 
So when your controller goes off

83
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,538 line:15% 
and performs an operation to retrieve data

84
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:04,304 line:15% 
from a backend system, like a database or web service,

85
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:05,373 line:15% 
or a Spring Bean,

86
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:09,179 line:15% 
you can take that data and place it into the model.

87
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,029 line:15% 
So the model again is your container,

88
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:12,648 line:15% 
like your suitcase or your luggage,

89
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:15,756 line:15% 
for shipping data between various parts

90
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:18,320 line:15% 
of your Spring MVC application.

91
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,707 line:15% 
So that model data will actually get passed

92
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:22,459 line:15% 
over to the view template

93
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,636 line:15% 
and they can actually handle that

94
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,364 line:15% 
for displaying the data.

95
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,992 line:15% 
That's kinda where we're at right now.

96
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:29,276 line:15% 
So the view template.

97
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,559 line:15% 
The most common view template that you'll use

98
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,892 line:15% 
is JSP and JSTL.

99
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,988 line:15% 
Spring MVC is very flexible.

100
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:38,175 line:15% 
There's many different view template types.

101
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,656 line:15% 
I'll talk about that in a second.

102
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:43,174 line:15% 
But for now let's just think about JSP, JSTL.

103
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:46,787 line:15% 
This model data comes over to your view template

104
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:50,931 line:15% 
and then your JSP page can read that model data

105
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,211 line:15% 
and display it.

106
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,394 line:15% 
So, say for example,

107
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:56,134 line:15% 
you have a list of students,

108
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:57,887 line:15% 
or list of products,

109
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,050 line:15% 
then your JSP page can create a table

110
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,861 line:15% 
to display that product list

111
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,724 line:15% 
or that student list.

112
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:07,303 line:15% 
Or, say for example, somebody is signing

113
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:08,835 line:15% 
up for an airline flight,

114
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,789 line:15% 
or is signing up for a class,

115
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,175 line:15% 
then your view template,

116
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,333 line:15% 
or your page can give them a confirmation,

117
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,315 line:15% 
hey, you're registered for the class,

118
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,213 line:15% 
here's your confirmation number.

119
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,862 line:15% 
So that's the idea of the view template.

120
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,886 line:15% 
It's basically a JSP page

121
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:25,803 line:15% 
that will provide data to the user.

122
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,271
Now as I mentioned,

123
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,439
Spring MVC is very flexible on the view templates.

124
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,428
There's actually other view templates

125
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:36,384
that are supported,

126
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,581
so if you don't wanna use JSP,

127
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,229
you can make use of some other templates

128
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,979
like Thymeleaf, Groovy, Velocity, Freemarker,

129
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,442
the list goes on.

130
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,347
You can plug in all different types of view templates.

131
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,534
If you'd like to get details on this,

132
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,501
go to this link I have on the screen,

133
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,974
luv2code.com/spring-mvc-views.

134
00:04:56,974 --> 00:05:00,487
This'll redirect you to the official Spring documentation

135
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,946
and you can get more information

136
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,508
on the various other templates

137
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:06,258
that are out there and available.

138
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,011
Alright, good.

139
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,977
This is a quick behind the scenes view

140
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,300
of Spring MVC.

141
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,975
You learned about the model, the view, the controller

142
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,059
and a conceptual theoretical level.

143
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,959
In the following videos we're gonna

144
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,240
start getting our hands dirty

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,292
and setting up our environment

146
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,942
and then starting to write some code.

147
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,775
So I'll see you there.
