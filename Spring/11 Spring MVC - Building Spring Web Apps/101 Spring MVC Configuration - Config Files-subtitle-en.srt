00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:03,123 line:15% 
<v Instructor>Alrighty so let's go ahead and move forward,</v>

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:05,512 line:15% 
so we're gonna go ahead and copy over some

3
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:09,679 line:15% 
of the starter config files for our Spring project.

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,008
So let's swing back over to our files system

5
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:20,185 line:15% 
where we have our classroom files or our starter files

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,403 line:15% 
and what I want to do now is look

7
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:25,570 line:15% 
into starter-files/Spring-mvc-demo/config

8
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,234 line:15% 
and inside of this directory there's

9
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,563 line:15% 
two starter files that we're gonna use.

10
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:34,813 line:15% 
Spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml and web.xml

11
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,694 line:15% 
And then we'll move over to our Web-INF directory

12
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:47,048 line:15% 
and then we'll paste them directly here.

13
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,798 line:15% 
So you paste them into the WEB-INF directory.

14
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,957
Alright great so at this point we should

15
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:57,290
have Spring-mvc-servlet.xml and web.xml,

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,301
and the reason I like to use these as starter files,

17
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,718
is because this is normally a common source

18
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:07,370
of problems that folks will have, incorrect XML files

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,585
and they can never get Spring MVC working.

20
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,482
So even myself, whenever I start a new project,

21
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:14,540
I have starter files that I copy and paste

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,341
from just to get myself started

23
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:18,082
because you can waste a lot of

24
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:20,529
time trying to get this working.

25
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:21,803
Alright so here's step one,

26
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:24,389
configuring a dispatcher servlet upfront.

27
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:28,556
This is the same information that we had from our slides,

28
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,468
and then step two is setting up the URL mapping.

29
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,412
So we're basically gonna map the URL pattern of just

30
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:39,519
slash basically all the web requests coming in.

31
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,609
We're gonna map it to our dispatcher servlet,

32
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,123
or our front controller,

33
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:46,534
that's part of the Spring MVC frameworks.

34
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:49,951
Alright so that's the web XML part of it.

35
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,370
Now let's go ahead and look at

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,243
this spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml.

37
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:59,410
So this is really just a Spring configuration file,

38
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,207
and a lot of this will look familiar to you,

39
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,734
especially this lines 14 and 15,

40
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,335
we're simply setting up components scanning,

41
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:12,502
so again, base package of com.luv2code.springdemo.

42
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:15,688
Step 4 we're adding support

43
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:18,410
for conversion formatting and validation.

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,243
We give the MVC:annotation-driven,

45
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,865
and then finally we set up this Spring MVC view resolver.

46
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:31,235
So again remember we can specify a prefix

47
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,235
and a suffix and this is where the view pages

48
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:38,334
will be located and Spring will automatically

49
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,251
add these values whenever you give a view name.

50
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,900
So this directory here or this folder,

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,785
we actually have to create this,

52
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,679
we have WEB-INF, but we don't have a /view/.

53
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,869
So this is something that we'll

54
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,182
actually have to create here in Eclipse.

55
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:56,849
Let's go ahead and do that now.

56
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,843
Alright so lets kind of swing back over.

57
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,389
So under WEB-INF we need to create a new folder here.

58
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,023
So I'll simply right click on WEB-INF

59
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:07,023
and I'll say New Folder,

60
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,307
and then the actual folder name it's very simple,

61
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,057
we just call it View,

62
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,260
and we'll keep all the other defaults

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,427
and then we'll hit Finish.

64
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,486
Alright cool so we have this view folder now.

65
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:28,327
So we have all the basic stuff in place

66
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:31,142
and set up for our Spring application.

67
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,034
Now we need to actually write some code (laughs)

68
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,173
and we'll do that the following videos.

69
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,058
So I'll give you a quick video

70
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,651
on how to create a controller class

71
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,749
and a view and then we'll actually write

72
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,761
our own controller class and views,

73
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,516
but anyways making sure we have

74
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,699
our Spring MVC project set up

75
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,037
and I dunno, we're good for now,

76
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,870
so I'll see you in the next video.
