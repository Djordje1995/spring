1
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:02,440
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,109
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,686
What we're gonna focus on in this video

4
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:08,573
is setting up our Spring MVC configuration,

5
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:12,740
and in particular, adding the JAR files to a Spring project.

6
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:31,252
So the first thing I'll do is actually go through

7
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,064
and create a new project.

8
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,641
So I'll go to File &gt; New,

9
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,641
and I'll choose Dynamic Web Project.

10
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,577
And the actual name I'll give for the project,

11
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:44,994
I'll call it spring-mvc-demo.

12
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,495
And once you're happy with that name,

13
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:55,662
keep all of the other defaults and then hit Finish.

14
00:00:56,644 --> 00:00:57,477
Okay, great.

15
00:00:57,477 --> 00:01:00,574
So now we have this very basic project that's empty.

16
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:03,324
There's not much there right now.

17
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,124 line:15% 
So the next you want to do is actually

18
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:11,918 line:15% 
copy over the Spring JAR files from our previous download,

19
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,197 line:15% 
and we're actually gonna place them into this lib directory

20
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:16,364 line:15% 
in WEB-INF/lib.

21
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,602
So let me swing back over to my file system

22
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,051
into that Downloads directory, and this is where

23
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,586
we downloaded the Spring Framework JAR files earlier

24
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,253
in a previous video.

25
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:35,470
So we already have this ZIP file unzipped, or uncompressed.

26
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,393
I'll expand this directory here,

27
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:39,194
and I'll go into the libs directory,

28
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,869
and this is where we have all of the Spring JAR files.

29
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,808
So this is from the Spring Framework, the core JAR files.

30
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:47,711
And I'll go ahead and just select all of the .jar files

31
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:51,864
located in this directory, and I'll highlight all of them

32
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,864
and then I'm gonna simply copy them.

33
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,397
And then I'll move back over to Eclipse,

34
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:03,287 line:15% 
I'll move into this WEB-INF/lib directory,

35
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,325 line:15% 
and this is a special directory

36
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,000 line:15% 
where we place the JAR files.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,519 line:15% 
I'll simply do a right-click and choose Paste,

38
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,464 line:15% 
and by putting them in the WEB-INF/lib directory,

39
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,210
they're automatically on our build path.

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,302
They're automatically on our class path.

41
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,469
So this looks good so far.

42
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:23,551 line:15% 
Now there's some additional files that we're gonna need.

43
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:24,853 line:15% 
Basically what we're gonna do now

44
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,067 line:15% 
is copy over some JAR files

45
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,331 line:15% 
from the Udemy source code download.

46
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:30,674 line:15% 
So in a previous lecture, I gave you a link to download

47
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,764 line:15% 
the Udemy source code for this class.

48
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:35,584 line:15% 
So you simply download that ZIP file

49
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:38,167 line:15% 
and unzip it, or uncompress it,

50
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,099 line:15% 
and then inside of this directory here,

51
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,616 line:15% 
we have some supporting files that we're gonna use,

52
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,919 line:15% 
and in particular, we're gonna make use

53
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,487 line:15% 
of some starter files.

54
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,791 line:15% 
So in this directory structure here,

55
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,958 line:15% 
go to spring/mvc/starter-files/spring-mvc-demo/lib.

56
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,859
So go ahead and grab those files.

57
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,785
Just do a right-click and choose Copy,

58
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,952
and we're gonna put those into our Eclipse project also.

59
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:16,746 line:15% 
And then we'll swing back over to Eclipse,

60
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:20,246 line:15% 
and in the lib directory, we'll hit Paste.

61
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:27,653
All right, so we're kind of good to go right now.

62
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,529
So at this point, we have the Spring Framework JAR files,

63
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,878
and the JSTL support JAR files.

64
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,312
So this is good so far.

65
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,495
We're in good shape.

66
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,145
In the next video, we'll start moving in

67
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,415
some of the Spring configuration files,

68
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,248
so I'll see you there.
