00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:02,849
<v Instructor>Hey, real quick in this video</v>

2
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:04,927
we're gonna discuss constructor injection

3
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:07,563
and what happens behind the scenes.

4
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:10,380
So, we have our screen configuration file

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,392
that's been created but you may wonder well,

6
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,510
what really happens behind the scenes

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,510
when Spring runs through or processes this file?

8
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,632
So, behind the scenes the Spring framework

9
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:26,430
will actually perform some operations for you

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,987
based on information you have in the config file

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,567
and I just want to kind of show you this code wise

12
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:34,004
so you get a better feel for what happens.

13
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,977
So, over on the left is our config file,

14
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:37,353
over on the right is kind of the work

15
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:41,121
that Spring will do for you behind the scenes.

16
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,244
Alright, so when you create that first bean,

17
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,251
myFortuneService of HappyFortuneService,

18
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,591
behind the scenes Spring will actually construct

19
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,882
that object for you,

20
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,171
so they'll actually call the default constructor

21
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,346
or the nor or constructor and they'll create

22
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:58,187
a HappyFortuneService,

23
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:01,690
and they'll give it the variable name of myFortuneService.

24
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,993
Alright, so that covers that first piece of it,

25
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:05,002
the first bean.

26
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:09,833
Now moving forward there's also a second bean, myCoach,

27
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,403
so here they'll actually create a new BaseballCoach

28
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:15,744
and based on the information from your config file,

29
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,904
they'll pass in a constructor argument

30
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:19,314
and that's the same myFortuneService

31
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,896
that we just created,

32
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,027
so they'll create that BaseballCoach

33
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:25,614
with that myFortuneService,

34
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,030
and again, make this bean available.

35
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,406
So, the key here is that Spring will do this work for you

36
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:34,353
in the background and Spring's object factory

37
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:36,952
when they kind of create your objects

38
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:39,268
and they inject the dependencies,

39
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:42,290
this is really what's going on behind the scenes

40
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,584
when Spring processes your file.

41
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,973
So, I hope this helps out a little bit.

42
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,499
I wanted to kind of just cover that real quickly

43
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:52,482
before we jumped into the actual coding.

44
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:56,149
Alright, so I'll see you in the next video.
