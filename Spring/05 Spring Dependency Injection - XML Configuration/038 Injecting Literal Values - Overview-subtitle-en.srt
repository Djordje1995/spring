1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:02,794
<v Teacher>Hey, in this video we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:06,961
how to inject literal values into our Spring objects.

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:10,335
So, currently we have our CricketCoach.

4
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,548
We've learned how to inject a FortuneService

5
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:13,654
to our CricketCoach.

6
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:15,781
But now we'd like to inject some literal values

7
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,417
like some string values.

8
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,929
So I'd like to inject

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,810
the actual email address for the coach,

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,985
and the actual team name for the coach,

11
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,473
like the Sunrisers.

12
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:25,760
Alright, so let's go ahead

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,505
and check out our development process for this.

14
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:32,147
So again, I love to do things step by step.

15
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:33,238
The first thing we're gonna do here

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,729
is create setter methods in our class for injections.

17
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,200
And then we'll also configure the injection

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,950
in our Spring configuration file.

19
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:46,003
Alright, so let's go ahead and take a look at step one.

20
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,241
Create setter methods in your class.

21
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,313
So here's our class CricketCoach.

22
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:52,169
Actually the first thing we wanna do

23
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:56,074
is create some private fields to hold these values.

24
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,741
So I'll have a private String for emailAddress,

25
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,052
and then a private String for team.

26
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:02,371
Once I have that set up,

27
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:05,018
then I need to set up public setter methods

28
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,122
for these fields here.

29
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:09,010
So I have a public void setEmailAddress,

30
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,371
public void setTeam.

31
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,204
And we'll cover the coding piece in the video.

32
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:21,342
Alright, so now that's taken care of, now we do step two.

33
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:24,593
Configure the injection in the Spring config file.

34
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:26,453
So again, here's myCricketCoach,

35
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,133
then I have these two new entries here

36
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:31,078
for property name equals emailAddress,

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,477
and then value, and then I give the actual value

38
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:34,533
of the email address.

39
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,895
Thebestcoach@luv2code.com.

40
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:39,533
And note here the attribute name is value equals,

41
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,828
as opposed to ref.

42
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:43,453
So value is used for literal values,

43
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:47,238
ref is used to refer to other objects or dependencies.

44
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:48,448
And then I just repeat the process here

45
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,864
for this next property, team.

46
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,086
So I give the actual value,

47
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:56,833
and I give the actual literal value here for the team.

48
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,946
Alright, so that's the basic process there

49
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:03,682
for injecting literal values into your Spring application.

50
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:06,410
In the next video, we'll dive into Eclipse,

51
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,394
and we'll actually write the code to make this happen.

52
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,977
Okay, I'll see ya there, in the next video.
