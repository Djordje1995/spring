1
00:00:01,225 --> 00:00:02,091
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:02,924
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,442
Let's get our hands dirty and write some code.

4
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:09,131
So we'll use the previous project from before.

5
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:11,642
Our development process, the first thing we need to do

6
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:15,399
is define the dependency interface and class.

7
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:18,674
So we'll go ahead and start off with the first step here.

8
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,424 line:15% 
The first thing we need to do is define an interface,

9
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:23,417 line:15% 
so I'll say New, Interface.

10
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,908
I'll give the name of this interface as FortuneService.

11
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:30,491
Once you're happy, click the Finish button.

12
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,499
So we have this very empty interface right here.

13
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:38,542
I'll simply define one method called getFortune,

14
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,466
and this method returns a string.

15
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,149
And since this is an interface,

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,174
there's no actual implementation code.

17
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:47,687
We simply have just a semicolon, no curly brace or anything,

18
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,854
just the method signature.

19
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,667
Okay, great, so that's our interface.

20
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,750 line:15% 
Now we actually need to create a class

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,250 line:15% 
to implement this interface.

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,749 line:15% 
So I'll do a right-click, I'll say New, Class.

23
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,495
What we'll do is we'll make use of that HappyFortuneService

24
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,662
that we saw on the slides.

25
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,013
And what we wanna do here

26
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:11,813
is move down to this Interfaces section that's empty,

27
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:14,333
but I wanna click this Add button

28
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,658
and actually add an interface to implement.

29
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:20,458
So up top, I'll type in fortune

30
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,392
and it will find FortuneService.

31
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,899
We'll go ahead and select that one.

32
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,299
That's the one that we just created in the previous section.

33
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,542
And I will hit OK.

34
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,057
And so we should have our interface listed here

35
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:34,349
in the Interfaces section.

36
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,283
Once you're happy with that,

37
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:39,200
move down to hit the Finish button.

38
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,874
Cool, so we have this HappyFortuneService.

39
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:45,625
Woo-hoo, I like it, getting excited here.

40
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:46,832
Let me expand the window.

41
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:49,467
So our HappyFortuneService

42
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:53,392
implements that interface FortuneService.

43
00:01:53,392 --> 00:01:55,100
With that implementation,

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,016
they gave us an auto-generated stub here

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,367
for that method getFortune.

46
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,250
But here, I'll just go ahead

47
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,507
and I'll put in my own little fortune here.

48
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:05,500
I'll just hardcode something for now.

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,899
I'll say, "Today is your lucky day!"

50
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,967
Yay, yeah (giggles).

51
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,766
And again, just a very simple implementation

52
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,058
that somebody can call this method

53
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:18,225
and they can get their actual fortune.

54
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,737
All right, so this looks pretty good so far.

55
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,196
Now, what I'd like to do is actually

56
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,316
move back over to my Coach interface

57
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,916
because in my Coach interface,

58
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,376 line:15% 
I actually wanna add a new method to this Coach interface.

59
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:40,433 line:15% 
Because our coach already gives daily workouts,

60
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:44,417 line:15% 
but now, we want our coach to also give daily fortunes.

61
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:47,334 line:15% 
So here, I'll say, getDailyFortune.

62
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:53,058 line:15% 
And again, just the method signature, no implementation.

63
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,107 line:15% 
So that's our Coach interface.

64
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,258 line:15% 
And then our class that implement this,

65
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,649 line:15% 
well then, they'll have to provide

66
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:00,982 line:15% 
some implementation support.

67
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,341 line:15% 
All right, so I'm going to save this Coach interface and,

68
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,741
ooh, I see some red exes here.

69
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:11,959 line:15% 
Oh, I broke some of the classes that implement Coach.

70
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,309 line:15% 
And the reason they broke, because those classes,

71
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:17,865 line:15% 
they don't implement all the methods (giggles).

72
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,441 line:15% 
So here we can just hover over that red squiggly

73
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,742 line:15% 
and then we can choose that little fix here

74
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,632 line:15% 
that Eclipse is suggesting.

75
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,357 line:15% 
We can add unimplemented methods.

76
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,617
Ooh, cool, I like it.

77
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,325
So Eclipse is helping us out here.

78
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,416
Eclipse said, "Hey, you need this new method

79
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,133
that the Coach interface has, and you don't have."

80
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,708
So they went ahead and gave it to us, so thank you, Eclipse.

81
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,724
And similar thing here for TrackCoach,

82
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:41,557
they don't have it either,

83
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:44,541
so we'll choose Add unimplemented methods.

84
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,708
So we're basically just fixing the code that we just broke.

85
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,549
And we'll leave it right now for return though.

86
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:52,925
We'll come back to that stuff later.

87
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,232
But at least we just have the method in there.

88
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:58,240
We have the placeholder in place

89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,073
just to make it pass the compiler.
