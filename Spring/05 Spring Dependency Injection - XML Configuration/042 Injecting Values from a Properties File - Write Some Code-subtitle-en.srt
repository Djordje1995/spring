1
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:03,867
<v Instructor>Alright so just moving into Eclipse here</v>

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:05,861
and looking at the Development Process.

3
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,487
The first thing we are going to do is create

4
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,154
the Properties File.

5
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:13,886
So what I will do here is I will click

6
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:15,105
on my source directory.

7
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:19,022
I will do a right click and I'll say New File.

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,911
And for the actual name of the file I will call it

9
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,328
sport.properties.

10
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:36,999
And once you're happy with that go ahead and click

11
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,749
on the Finish button.

12
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:42,571
Now we simply add the values here for our Properties file.

13
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,493
So our first Property name is called foo.email

14
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,394
and then I simply just enter a value here for the

15
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:49,561
email address.

16
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:53,146
Then I do a similar thing here for the actual team name.

17
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:56,988
So foo.team= and I simply give the team name.

18
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:00,318
So again you can give any property name that you want,

19
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:03,259
you simply have to be consistent with the actual value

20
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,624
in this Props file and which you use in the

21
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,207
Spring config file.

22
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:11,238
Alright so this looks pretty good here for the basic

23
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,738
Properties file for right now.

24
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:18,478
Alright so let's go ahead and move over to Step 2.

25
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,627
So Step 2 is loading the Properties File in our

26
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,210
Spring config file.

27
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,297
So I am going to actually open up my application

28
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,897
context.xml file.

29
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:27,814
Expand the window here.

30
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:32,945
And what I want to do, right near the top here,

31
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:34,294
like around,

32
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,544
let's see here,

33
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,461
yes, like on line 10.

34
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,987
What I want to do here is actually add a reference

35
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,253
for that context property placeholder.

36
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:46,451
This is what we use to actually load the Props

37
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:49,201
file into the Spring environment.

38
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,041
So I make use of context:property-placeholder

39
00:01:56,636 --> 00:01:57,469
and then I give the actual location.

40
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,916
So this file is going to be on our classpath:

41
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:01,749
So I say classpath: and then I give the name of our

42
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:05,416
actual Properties file, so sport.properties.

43
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,893
and that is file that we just created.

44
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:12,560
And, oh my, I normally put my comments first

45
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,594
but I will put the comments last. (chuckles)

46
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,427
So here I will just make comments for myself.

47
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,427
Load the Properties file

48
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:22,288
sport.properties.

49
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:24,649
It's just a way to kind of jog my memory when I go

50
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:27,467
back in and look at this file at a later time.

51
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,467
So good job.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,894
Alright, so then the next step here is Step 3.

53
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,168
Reference the values from the Property file.

54
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,672
So again this is our CricketCoach here that we have

55
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:44,901
been working on so far, and on Lines 34 and 35 we have

56
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,120
values hard-coded.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,953
And what I would like to do is instead, is make use

58
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:50,809
of that information from the Properties file.

59
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,405
So again I make use of that syntax right.

60
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,961
${ and the actual property name.

61
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:00,367
So here, that foo.email, that is the Property name.

62
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,560
And then I will just kind of move back over here

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,143
and use that ${ and then I give

64
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,943
the actual property name, foo.email.

65
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:11,179
Make sure that it's the same name that you have from

66
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,512
the config file.

67
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:16,189
Alright so that covers us for the email.

68
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:19,772
Let's do a similar thing here for foo.team.

69
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,655
Then I will just move back over to my configuration file.

70
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:27,238
And here I will say ${foo.team.

71
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:32,480
Alright.

72
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:38,074
Excellent. Looks very good so far.

73
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,134
So that is it. So instead of hard-coded values,

74
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,915
now I am going to read those values from the actual

75
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:44,748
Properties file.

76
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:45,990
So this is great. I like this.

77
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,368
The app is kind of very flexible at this point

78
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,856
and also very configurable.

79
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,975
So, in fact we actually have a config file

80
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:56,279
for the config file right. (chuckles)

81
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,084
We have this Sport.properties that is used in the

82
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:01,424
configure spring config. Anyways we are all good.

83
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:05,591
So what we can do now is actually run our demo app.

84
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:10,250
Set our demo app.java so once we open up this file

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,530
here there is really no changes that we have to do.

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,030
We are simply changing how the screen is reading

87
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,393
information from the configs.

88
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:19,826
So all this stuff we can keep the same, no changes,

89
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,045
and we can just simply run it.

90
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:25,212
So I just do a right click Run As Java Application.

91
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:32,169
And then we can take a look at the results here.

92
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,761
And, yeah, looking really good here.

93
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:35,797
Looking really good.

94
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:39,605
So at the bottom we have our coach's email address

95
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:41,699
and also the team, so it is actually reading that

96
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,130
information from that file Sport.properties and then

97
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,656
plugging those values in there.

98
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:49,310
So this is great. I love it. I love it.

99
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,560
Things work as planned. How about that.

100
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,600
Now let's test it out though.

101
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,534
Let's go back and change our Properties file.

102
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:01,550
Just to verify that it really really is working. (chuckles)

103
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,643
And I am going to change the email address here to

104
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:08,181
silly. And I am going to change the team name to

105
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:11,777
a really really awesome team here.

106
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:15,804
I am going to put in this special super team.

107
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:19,554
And it's called the Mighty Java Coders. Yeah.

108
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,672
And it's composed of all of us right because

109
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,244
we are all super heroes and we are all

110
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:27,293
super athletes.

111
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,635
And we can beat any other cricket team out there.

112
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:31,269
Right. (chuckles)

113
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:33,390
Alright. So let's try this. So we saved it.

114
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,314
Again, since it is a Properties file no need to

115
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,110
change the application, simply run the application again.

116
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,447
And it should pick up those new properties.

117
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:42,074
And let's take a look at it.

118
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,670
Yeah! Alright! Good Stuff!

119
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,161
So, there's our team name, Mighty Java Coders,

120
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,173
and our email address silly@luv2code.

121
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:52,691
So this is great. Woohoo!

122
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,505
We are rocking and rolling.

123
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,367
So we have accomplished that item of actually reading

124
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,262
information from the Properties file

125
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:02,219
so it is not hard-coded in our spring configs.

126
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:06,386
So I would like to say Good Job! and Congratulations!
