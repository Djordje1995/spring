00:00:01,271 --> 00:00:02,208
<v Instructor>In this video</v>

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,359
we're gonna learn how to inject values

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,276
from a properties file.

4
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:11,580
Alright, so in the previous videos

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,636
we learnt how to inject literal values,

6
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,326
so we could inject an email address in the team.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,162
The only problem is that those values

8
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,908
were hard coded in the config file

9
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:22,714
and what we'd like to do is be able to read

10
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:26,005
this information from our properties file.

11
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,318
So, we'll have an external properties file,

12
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:29,839
we'll have our values there

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,691
and then we'll be able to read the email address

14
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:36,024
and team name from this properties file.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,539
Alright, again, you know how I love

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,810
my step-by-step process,

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,947
so the first thing we're gonna have to do here

18
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,216
is create the properties file,

19
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:47,541
then we'll load the properties file

20
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,842
into the Spring config file

21
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,651
and then finally in step three

22
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:55,818
we'll reference those values from the properties file.

23
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,711
Alright, so let's go ahead and look at step one,

24
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,250
creating a properties file, right.

25
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,094
Very simple.

26
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:05,795
Simply open a text editor,

27
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,279
create a file, in this case, sport.properties

28
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,541
and you simply give the name value pairs.

29
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,788
So, the name of the property is foo.email

30
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,478
and the value is myeasycoach.

31
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:16,792
The actual property names,

32
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,531
you can give any name that you want.

33
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,807
There's no direct relation

34
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,319
to your actual bean.

35
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,942
You can call them foo bar, test, funny, bozo, anything.

36
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:28,382
The only thing is that you simply have to be consistent

37
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:30,958
between referring to the property name

38
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,630
in this config file and also referring to the property name

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,380
in your Spring setup.

40
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,522
Alright, so those are our properties.

41
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:43,078
Now step two is loading the properties file

42
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:44,518
in the Spring config,

43
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:47,091
so in your application context.xml

44
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:50,590
you simply make use of this context:property-placeholder,

45
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,023
you give the location for it,

46
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,655
so in this case the file will be on our classpath,

47
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,536
and then you give the actual file name,

48
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:57,825
so in this example

49
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,094
our properties file's called sport.properties

50
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:03,634
and so I'll actually load that properties file

51
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,296
into memory and then you can use it

52
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,879
within this Spring config file.

53
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,606
So, now this brings us to step three,

54
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,241
referencing the values from the properties file.

55
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,210
So, the general syntax is you simply use

56
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,055
the dollar sign, curly brace

57
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,459
and you give whatever the property name is

58
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,491
and then Spring will actually substitute

59
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,065
that property value directly there.

60
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,143
So, in this case for email address,

61
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,729
I simply give value

62
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,193
equals dollar sign, curly brace, foo.email,

63
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,974
so foo.email's the actual property name

64
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,371
from that prop's file

65
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,454
and that will include the value of myeasycoach@luv2code.

66
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,682
And then here I do a similar thing here for the team.

67
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:48,317
So, I reference that property name foo.team,

68
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:49,765
and again, based on information

69
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,370
from the properties file

70
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,538
it will actually put in the value

71
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,537
of Royal Challengers Bangalore.

72
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:56,462
So, that's basically it

73
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,847
and you can add additional props in there as you like

74
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,026
and simply reference them.

75
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:02,323
So, the key item here is that you reference

76
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:06,057
those values using the dollar sign, curly brace,

77
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,881
and then whatever that property name is.

78
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,411
Alright, so good stuff here.

79
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:13,200
In the next video we're gonna dive into Eclipse

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,135
and we'll actually write this code.

81
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,635
Alright, so I'll see you then.
