1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:03,186
<v Darby>All righty, so let's do a check point</v>

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:04,489
on our development process.

3
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:06,450
We've already covered step one of adding

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,795
the validation rule to our customer class.

5
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:10,381
Now we'll move to step two,

6
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,214
displaying the error message on the HTML form.

7
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:18,780
All righty, so moving into Eclipse,

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,181
we actually need to create the HTML form.

9
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,494
So let's go ahead and move down

10
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:24,994
to our WEB-INF view directory.

11
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,021
We're gonna create a new file.

12
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:35,804
And the actual name of the file,

13
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,471
we'll call it customer-form.jsp.

14
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:41,802
And once you're happy with that,

15
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:45,392
go ahead and click on the finish button.

16
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:47,580
All righty, so here's our empty file right now.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,747
Let's go ahead and expand the window here for a second.

18
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,344
And the first thing I wanna do is add

19
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:59,354
the reference for the spring form tag library.

20
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,758
So make sure you enter your information

21
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:04,359
the same way I have it here on this screen.

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,195
So you may wanna pause the video,

23
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:09,028
type in exactly as I have it here.

24
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,785
And now I'll go through and start

25
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:16,183
just putting up my basic HTML page.

26
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:19,183
So I'll do HTML head, and then body.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,334
I'll go ahead and add a title here for this page,

28
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:33,318
and I'll call it Customer Registration Form.

29
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,735
Real fancy, oooh.

30
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,233
And here's a little screenshot to the right

31
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,206
as far as what I want the form to look like,

32
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,649
basically the first name and last name.

33
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,317
So I'll go ahead and lay out the basic HTML

34
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:49,400
form here using the spring form tags.

35
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:54,060
So I'll have form action equals process form

36
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:59,507
and then the model attribute will be customer,

37
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,216
and that's the same customer class that

38
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:05,383
we just created in the previous video.

39
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,893
And one other thing I wanna do is I wanna stretch out here,

40
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:12,393
give myself some, give myself some white space.

41
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,976
I love white space.

42
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:18,048
So, kind of just moving things around a bit,

43
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,003
and now let's go ahead and lay out the fields

44
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:22,895
here for first name and also for last name.

45
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,686
These are the input fields that the user

46
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,853
will see on the HTML form.

47
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,185
So I have form colon input,

48
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,268
then I'll set path equals first name,

49
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:42,890
and I'll keep it simple for that one.

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,890
I'll add some line breaks here after this entry.

51
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,834
And I'll do a similar thing here for the last name field.

52
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,917
So form input, path equals last name.

53
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,775
Now, the only thing that's different here is that

54
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:06,039
I'm actually gonna add a field to display the errors.

55
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,046
So in the event that there is an error message

56
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,035
I wanna display it here.

57
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,447
So I'll say form colon errors path last name,

58
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,552
and then I give a reference to a CSS class.

59
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,080
But basically here on line 18 where I'm saying hey,

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,011
display an error message if an error message has been set.

61
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,518
Now the first time we show the form

62
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:24,823
we won't see any error messages.

63
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,459
You'll only see that if validation

64
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,426
fails after a form submission.

65
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,817
So a good segue here for this next item.

66
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:33,898
We actually need to add our submit button,

67
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,481
to submit the data.

68
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,018
So I'll set up input type equals submit

69
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,534
and value equals submit.

70
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:46,989
Value's the actual label that'll

71
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,406
show up on the submit button.

72
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,079
All righty, so just kind of stepping back for a second.

73
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,938
This looks pretty good.

74
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:58,299
So this is my basic HTML form for reading the users,

75
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,106
I'm sorry, for reading the customer's first name

76
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:04,689
and last name along with the submit button.

77
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:12,122
All right, and I'll just do some little cosmetic stuff here.

78
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,026
I'll put an asterisk here to let the user know

79
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:17,237
that it's required, and I'll also just add this text

80
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:21,068
up at the top on the form, just so the user can read that.

81
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,401
Now this is mainly just cosmetic stuff.

82
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,424
I could use any type of symbol

83
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,312
to say that a field is required.

84
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:30,200
This is simply for display purposes only.

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,816
The real validation part happens

86
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:34,152
because of the validation rules that we have set up

87
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:38,319
in our customer class that we did in the previous video.

88
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:40,991
All right, so just adding my little

89
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,557
cosmetic labels here at the top.

90
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,860
Make sure I could spell asterisk properly.

91
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,267
(laughing)

92
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,281
It's such a weird word to actually write out and try

93
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,594
and spell it yourself, but I think I got it right.

94
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,761
If not, please correct me.

95
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:58,219
I'll just put it in italics.

96
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:01,825
All right, so that looks pretty good.

97
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:03,325
Looks pretty good.

98
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,287
All right so the main thing here was adding

99
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,106
that form errors, and we have the CSS style.

100
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,074
Remember I said I'll cover that later,

101
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,916
and this is where we're covering it right now.

102
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,332
So, I'm referencing a CSS style called error.

103
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:20,901
So that means in my GSP page I need to either define

104
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,977
that style or I could import it.

105
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,466
Right now I'm just gonna keep it simple.

106
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,868
I'll just define the CSS style in line,

107
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,418
but you could also create this

108
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:31,305
on a separate file for pulling that in.

109
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:32,660
But now I'll just keep it simple.

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,035
So I'll say .error color red,

111
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,353
and again, this is really simple.

112
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,315
I'm, I'm not a CSS guru.

113
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:41,448
I know the very basics of CSS.

114
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:45,276
But this will give us the result of displaying the color,

115
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:47,859
displaying the text in the red.

116
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,006
So that's my style.

117
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,212
Let me kind of clean up, tighten up the screen

118
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,429
here a little bit, just so we can get

119
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,463
everything on one page, and there we go.

120
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,296
So here we go.

121
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:58,522
We have our style up top, error,

122
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:01,645
and then we reference that CSS class on line 24.

123
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,519
So that's kind of how things map up,

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,950
and that will apply the appropriate red font

125
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,610
for the error message if an error message is there.

126
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,239
Now you may wonder well, where is the is required?

127
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,575
Where, where does that text come from?

128
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,292
Well remember in our class customer that we created

129
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,493
in the previous video when we set up our validation rule,

130
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:23,260
we had at not null, and then here we actually

131
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,399
listed the message of is required.

132
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,461
So if the validation fails for that field,

133
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,299
then that's the error message that will

134
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,595
be displayed on the actual screen.

135
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:33,716
So that's how those two things

136
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:36,546
kind of map together and tie up.

137
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,301
All right, so that kind of pulls it all together for us.

138
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,266
Okay, good stuff, good stuff.

139
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,866
All right, so I'll see you in the next video

140
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,533
as we continue with our development process.
