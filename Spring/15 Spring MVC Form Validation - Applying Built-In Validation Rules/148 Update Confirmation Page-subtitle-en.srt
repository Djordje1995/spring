1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:02,533
<v Darby>All right, so we're making</v>

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:04,093
really good progress here.

3
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:06,158
We've covered the first three steps.

4
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:09,837
Our last step here is updating the confirmation page.

5
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,934
Or in fact, we actually have to create

6
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:14,973
the confirmation page so we can send them

7
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,605
to our success page.

8
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,688 line:15% 
And we'll do that here in this video.

9
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,582 line:15% 
So I'm just going to move over to my View folder

10
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,501
here on the WEB-INF view.

11
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:30,668
And I'll create a new file for customer confirmation.

12
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:39,306
For the file name, I'll give it customer-confirmation.jsp.

13
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,184
And once you're happy with that,

14
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:47,517
go ahead and click on the finish button.

15
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,629
All right, so here we go.

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,509
Let me go and maximize my screen for a second.

17
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,261
I'm gonna add in the taglib reference.

18
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:02,195
We're not using it immediately yet,

19
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,786
but we will use it in some later videos,

20
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:06,822
so I'll just go ahead and put it in now for safe keepings.

21
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:09,136
Again, you can pause the video and type it in exactly

22
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,475
like I have it here.

23
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,873
And let's go ahead and set up some work here

24
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,373
for our HTML page.

25
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:18,473
So I'll set up HTML, set my head,

26
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:22,640
and also kinda spell out the body here for a second.

27
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,615
Drop in a quick title here for "Customer Confirmation."

28
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,115
This is my success page, yeah.

29
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:40,807
And this confirmation page is gonna be really simple.

30
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:43,412
All I'm doing is I'm simply echoing

31
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:46,870
the customer's first name and the customer's last name.

32
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,412
And I'm making use of the JSP expression language

33
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:54,062
to display the information for the first and last name.

34
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,244
And we've all seen this before,

35
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:58,848
so this is nothing new here right now.

36
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:00,881
But I have to at least create the page

37
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,878
just so with our validation we're actually sending it

38
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:05,932
to a confirmation page that has been created.

39
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:10,099
So that's kinda why we're going through this process.

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,336
Fun, fun, fun.

41
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,522
Now, let's go ahead and let's run the application

42
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:18,185
because we've covered all four steps here

43
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:19,713
of our validation process here.

44
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:21,393
So let's go ahead and run it.

45
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:25,048
So right-click "Run As," and choose "Run On Server."

46
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:26,727
And here's our main menu.

47
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,894
Let's go ahead and click the link here for "Customer form."

48
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,490
And let's just test it real quick,

49
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,747
let's just go ahead and hit submit

50
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:37,197
without providing any data.

51
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:40,197
And, okay, not what I was expecting.

52
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,902
What the what?

53
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,922
Okay, this is fun.

54
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:52,806
So I think I know what happened.

55
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,387
So let me go and dig back into the source code

56
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:59,220
and try to identify what happened.

57
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:05,116
So let's move back over to our customer.java class.

58
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:15,926
Ah, I see the problem in customer.java.

59
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,978
I didn't follow my own slides.

60
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,940
So in the slides I actually have the message

61
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,414
for the size, but I didn't have it there.

62
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:26,050
So I'm just getting the default error message.

63
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,709
So here I'm going to give my own custom message,

64
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,209
of message="is required".

65
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:33,466
That's what I should really have here.

66
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,013
Now, note for @NotNull I kind of left that empty,

67
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,304
I'm not matching my slides exactly.

68
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,739
But I will come back to that later.

69
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,450
So let's just cover one thing at a time here.

70
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,700
So let me refresh the form.

71
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:48,717
And then do a submit, and great.

72
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:51,509
So now I'm getting the "is required" as desired.

73
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,241
So that is working and I'm getting

74
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,665
the proper error message for that.

75
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,087
So let me go ahead and enter some data here

76
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:02,938
for a Bob Smith, and then go ahead and hit submit.

77
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,585
And ooh, good, so that passes.

78
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,535
So our validation logic is working.

79
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:10,185
If there were errors, it sent me back to the form.

80
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:11,485
If everything was okay,

81
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,092
then it sent us the confirmation page.

82
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:16,128
So that's good, we're making some good steps here.

83
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:18,520
But there are some other things I'm gonna show you

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,351
in some of the following videos,

85
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,101
so don't go anywhere, stay tuned.
