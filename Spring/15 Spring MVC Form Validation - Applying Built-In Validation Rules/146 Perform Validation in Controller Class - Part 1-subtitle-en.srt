1
00:00:01,684 --> 00:00:03,326
<v Darby>All right, so we're making good progress</v>

2
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:04,718
with our development process here.

3
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:05,822
We've already covered step one,

4
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:08,462
of adding the validation rule to Customer class.

5
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:09,915
And we also finished with step two,

6
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:12,952
of displaying the error message on the HTML form.

7
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:14,690
Now we actually need to move to step three,

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,902
and that's performing the validation

9
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:17,902
in the Controller class.

10
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,380 line:15% 
Now what I actually need to do,

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,083 line:15% 
is I actually need to create the Controller class.

12
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,232 line:15% 
Because I don't have it yet.

13
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,259 line:15% 
So I need to move on to my source directory.

14
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,426
And to our package here, and I'll create a new class.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,620
And the name that I'll give for this class

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,537
is customer controller.

17
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:45,252
I'll keep all the other defaults here.

18
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,919
And I'll hit finish.

19
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,114
All righty, so let me go ahead and, kind of,

20
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:52,915
expand the window here.

21
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,390
For this customer controller, I'm gonna set up

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,223
a request mapping, up top for this controller.

23
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,739
And this is work that we've all seen before.

24
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,001
We already know how to do all of this stuff.

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,001
Let me go ahead and fix the imports, real quick.

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,028
Okay, great, so the basics are set up for right now.

27
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:19,257
What I'd like to do is actually set up a request mapping,

28
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:22,172
just to show the actual form.

29
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:26,255
And also to add the model attribute for the form.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,262
So I'll define this method here.

31
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,929
Show form, that takes the model.

32
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,396
And inside of this method here,

33
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,796
I basically, just wanna add a model attribute here.

34
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:42,363
So I'll say, the model dot add attribute.

35
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,882
I'll give the name comma value pair

36
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:46,682
for that model attribute.

37
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:48,531
From our form, we know that the model attribute

38
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,283
name is customer.

39
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:52,715 line:15% 
And then we simply give it a new customer object.

40
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:53,951 line:15% 
Just a blank customer object.

41
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,274 line:15% 
Just to start out with.

42
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:58,024 line:15% 
For the actual form data binding.

43
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,449 line:15% 
And then I go, return on customer form

44
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:05,950 line:15% 
I'll actually return it back to customer form dot jsp.

45
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,092 line:15% 
Based on our configuration.

46
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:08,925 line:15% 
Oh yeah, one more thing

47
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,079 line:15% 
I forgot up here.

48
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,831 line:15% 
I actually need to put in request mapping

49
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,820 line:15% 
the actual path to show this form.

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,737 line:15% 
So I'll say, show form.

51
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:27,083 line:15% 
And that's basically it here for this first method here.

52
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,284 line:15% 
Our request mapping for actually showing the form.

53
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,959 line:15% 
And we've seen this work before

54
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,023 line:15% 
of simply adding an attribute for the model attribute.

55
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,194 line:15% 
Giving it a new customer object.

56
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:40,027 line:15% 
All right, this looks good so far.

57
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:44,756
So now, I actually wanna move to my

58
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,936
main menu dot jsp and set up a link

59
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,188
for the customer form.

60
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:49,198
Just so we can access it,

61
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,308
directly from our main menu.

62
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:53,165
So we don't have to do any manual pecking

63
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,892
on the URL location bar.

64
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,379
So let me just do a little copy paste here.

65
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,877
I'll just copy this section here for student form.

66
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,688
Then I'll just paste it real quick.

67
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:03,419
Then I'll simply just do an update here.

68
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,362
So I'll call it, customer form.

69
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,658
And for the link.

70
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:10,825
I'll make use of the href customer slash show form.

71
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:17,837
All righty, so this looks pretty good here.

72
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:21,370
Well now what I want to do is actually

73
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,931
test this out to make sure that we can

74
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,257
actually show the customer form.

75
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:26,709
All right, so let's go over to our

76
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,556
application here and let's run it.

77
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:29,781
Just do a right click, say run as

78
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:31,281
and run on server.

79
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:35,567
And here's our main menu, our home page.

80
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,957
And we have a new link here, customer form.

81
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,266
It looks really good.

82
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,683
Let's try it out.

83
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:42,575
And all right, good job.

84
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,327
So here's our form.

85
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:47,096
Kind of like the stuff we put in the previous video.

86
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,813
It's there but we don't really have

87
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,314
any processing code yet.

88
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,240
We haven't really done that part of it yet.

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,431
So if I hit the submit button,

90
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,083
Whahhhh!

91
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,067 line:15% 
404, but we know about that, right?

92
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,101 line:15% 
We don't have the mapping yet, for process form.

93
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:03,191 line:15% 
We'll actually add that in the next video.

94
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,535 line:15% 
So we still have some work to do.

95
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,368 line:15% 
So I'll see you in the next video.
