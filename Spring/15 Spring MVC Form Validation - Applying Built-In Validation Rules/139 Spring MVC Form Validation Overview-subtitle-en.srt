00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:03,248
<v Darby>In this video, we're gonna learn about</v>

2
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:05,498
Spring MVC form validation.

3
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:10,801
So what's the need for validation?

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,889
Well, you may have a form, and you may wanna validate

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,770
the fields to make sure you have required fields.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,902
You also may wanna validate numbers in a given range.

7
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:22,349
You may wanna validate the format, for example,

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,970
for a postal code.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,550
Or you may wanna add your own custom business rule

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,800
for validation.

11
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:36,960
So we can make use of Java's standard Bean Validation API.

12
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:41,170
This API's defined in JSR-303 and 309.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,437
And it defines a meta model and API for entity validation.

14
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:50,823
So this Bean Validation API is available for server-side

15
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:53,980
applications and also client-side applications using

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,228
like JavaFX or Swing.

17
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:58,649
This is all defined at this one website here,

18
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,767
beanvalidation.org.

19
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:05,658
It has all the documentation along with sample code.

20
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:08,473
Now let's talk about Spring support for validation.

21
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,822
So Spring version four and higher supports

22
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:14,551
the Bean Validation API, which is a good thing.

23
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,260
So it's actually the preferred method for validation

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,189
when building Spring apps.

25
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,899
You simply add the Validation JARs to our project,

26
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,828
use the appropriate annotations, and you're ready to go.

27
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:28,979
So the Bean Validation features, you can check to see

28
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,842
if a field is required, you can validate a length,

29
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,431
you can validate numbers, validate with regular expressions,

30
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,848
custom validation, and so on.

31
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,029
All right, so let's take a look at some validation

32
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:44,162
annotations, and these are all fairly self-explanatory,

33
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:45,349
but I'll go through them.

34
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:49,205
@NotNull makes sure that the given value is not null.

35
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:52,656
@Min and @Max, those basically apply to a number

36
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,885
to make sure it falls within a given range.

37
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,050
You also have @Size to make sure that the value

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,844
matches a given size as far as the number of characters

39
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:02,875
or the number of digits.

40
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,464
You can also apply regular expression patterns

41
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:06,714
using @Pattern.

42
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:10,217
And then you have @Future and @Past.

43
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,909
These apply to dates, so the date must be in the future,

44
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,256
or it must be in the past.

45
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,448
And there are also some others.

46
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:18,577
All right, so let's go ahead and take a look

47
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,091
at our road map here as far as what we're gonna do.

48
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,930
First thing we're gonna do is set up our

49
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,125
development environment, then we'll write code

50
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,486
to check for a required field.

51
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:32,376
Next we'll validate a number range with min and max.

52
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:36,740
Next we'll move forward and we'll apply regular expressions.

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,497
And then we'll do custom validation, this is kind of like

54
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:41,373
the big grand finale.

55
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:44,037
We'll actually create our own custom validation rule

56
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,944
along with our own custom Java annotation.

57
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,950
Really great stuff, so stay tuned.

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,817
We'll walk through each of these step by step

59
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:52,056
in the following videos.

60
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:56,056
So I'll see you there in the next video, yo, yo.
