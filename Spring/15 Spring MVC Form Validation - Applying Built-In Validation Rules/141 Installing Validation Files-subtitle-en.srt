1
00:00:01,864 --> 00:00:03,425
<v Darby>All right, so let's go ahead and move</v>

2
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:05,277
into our development environment here

3
00:00:05,277 --> 00:00:07,407
and let's kind of get things set up.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,579
So what I'll do is I'll actually open up a web browser

5
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:12,139
and I'll go ahead and download the hibernate validation

6
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:13,462
jar files.

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:17,629
So I go to hibernate.org and this is the main website.

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,225
Now I'll make use of the validation framework

9
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,402
that's over on the far right side.

10
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:24,126
So just move over there and click on the blue button

11
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:25,376
there for more.

12
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:31,870
So now we're at the Hibernate validation website here.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,105
I'll go ahead and click on the green button

14
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:37,329
to start the download process.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,526
Depending on your internet speed this can happen

16
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,839
very fast or it can happen very slow.

17
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,060
But eventually you'll get the actual zipfile

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,393
downloaded to your computer.

19
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:51,903
Now let me swing over to my file system here.

20
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:56,070
I'll go look at my downloads directory and I have a file

21
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:00,772
here called hibernate-validator.zip.

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:08,539
I'll go ahead and double click this file to unzip it.

23
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,979
Okay great so now it's unzipped and has a lot

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,284
of good things in here.

25
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:14,740
I'll go ahead and expand my folder here.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,867
So I have a dist directory and it has jar files

27
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,119
and also a supporting lib directory.

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,619
This looks really good so far.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,084
What I want to do is kind of swing back over to eclipse,

30
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,693
get that window back up because I want to add

31
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,526
some of these jar files to my eclipse project.

32
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:38,641
I'll kind of resize the windows here so I can see them

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,140
both at the same time.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,542
I'll go ahead and highlight the first three

35
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,125
hibernate-validator files here.

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,600
Then I'll copy those.

37
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,348
Then I'll move over to eclipse and I'll paste those

38
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,191
into my Web-INF lib directory, right?

39
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:01,358
That's where we place all of our third-party jar files.

40
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:04,143
All right great, so I've added those.

41
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:06,337
Now there are some additional files that are required.

42
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:09,520
So under lib, slash, required go ahead and select

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,612
all of the files in lib, slash, required.

44
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,195
Select those items.

45
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:23,281
Then I'll move back over to eclipse and my WEB-INF

46
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,364
directory and I'll paste those files.

47
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,953
So there we go, we've added those hibernate-validation files

48
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,286
to our projects.

49
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:36,668
All of those jar files that are in there now,

50
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:37,870
so we're good to go.

51
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,914
In the following videos we'll actually start coding

52
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:43,248
with these and applying the validation rules accordingly.

53
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,778
But at least at this point we're all set up

54
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,278
and we are ready to go, yo yo.
