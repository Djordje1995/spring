00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,653
<v Darby>In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:04,616
how to set up our development environment

3
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:07,199
for Spring MVC form validation.

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:10,751
Now we've already discussed the Java standard

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:14,243
Bean Validation API, but the important thing here

6
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:17,052
is to know that this is only a specification.

7
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:19,391
It's vendor independent, it's portable.

8
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:22,789
However, we still need an implementation.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,904
We need something that implements the spec.

10
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:28,595
So this is where Hibernate comes in the play.

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,443
Hibernate to the rescue!

12
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,796
So Hibernate originally started as an ORM project,

13
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,033
or object to relational mapping project.

14
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:38,342
However, in recent years, they've expanded

15
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,487
into other areas.

16
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,679
So now they have a fully compliant

17
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,334
JSR-303/309 implementation.

18
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:48,107
So they have an implementation of the validation framework,

19
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,286
which is really, really cool.

20
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,775
And also it's not tied to the ORM or database work.

21
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:57,942
It's actually a separate project just for doing validation.

22
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,207
So here's the actual website,

23
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:03,207
hibernate.org/validator.

24
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:06,395
Again, it's its own separate project for doing validation,

25
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,309
and it's fully compliant with the Java Beans

26
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:12,372
Validation API, so they implement the spec

27
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,289
to the T, and it works out really, really nice.

28
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,903
Here's the actual development process.

29
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:21,702
Basically what you'll do is you'll download

30
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:24,693
the Validation JAR files from the Hibernate website,

31
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:28,012
and then you'll add those JAR files to your project.

32
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,768
So in the following videos, we'll actually go through this

33
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,210
step by step, and I'll show you how to get your project

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,978
set up to make use of Spring MVC form validation

35
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:40,311
with the Hibernate Validation JAR files.
