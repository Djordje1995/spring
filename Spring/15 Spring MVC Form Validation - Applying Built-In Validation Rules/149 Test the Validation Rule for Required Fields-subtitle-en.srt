1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,088
<v Darby>Well, we have our validation up and running</v>

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:06,462
and I wanna do some experiments here.

3
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:08,753
And I'll try and break it.

4
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:12,920
I wanna try and find some edge cases that'll mess it up.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,715
Alright, so the one thing I wanna do, though,

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,293
before I get into that part is I wanna add

7
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,267
some logging messages or some debug messages here

8
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:22,183
to my controller.

9
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,604
And I actually just wanna print out the last name

10
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:26,873
that's coming in for the customer,

11
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:29,314
just so I can see it at the console and I don't know,

12
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,946
just do some quick diagnostics for it.

13
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,991
So I'll print out the last name for debugging.

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,848
So I'll just move down into my customer controller

15
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,608
and I'll keep it very simple here.

16
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:40,106
I'll just do a system.out.println.

17
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,939
And I'll just print out last name.

18
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll actually put a vertical bar here,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,579
right before the end quote

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,885
and then I'll print out theCustomer.getLastName

21
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,115
and then I'll append another vertical bar,

22
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,286
just so I can see if there's any white spaces

23
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:59,121
or any funny business going on here.

24
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,303
So that'll just give me a visual representation

25
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,920
of what's actually being passed in

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,074
for the customer's last name.

27
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,136
A little coding trick that I use

28
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:09,262
or that I've learned from over the years.

29
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:11,041
So it's debugging output, 'cause it's really hard

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,435
to figure out if you really have any leading

31
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,178
or trailing white space.

32
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:16,485
Alright, so we have that in place

33
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,215
and we're good to go with that.

34
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:20,715
Now let's go ahead and run it.

35
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,337
And we'll see how this works out to my customer form.

36
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,440
And now I'll just hit Submit.

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,302
I won't enter any data, just hit Submit

38
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,212
and see what I get on the console.

39
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:33,697
So we kinda pull up a window here at the bottom.

40
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,277
And last name, so two vertical bars,

41
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:36,768
nothing in the middle, that's fine.

42
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,764
Okay, so it says is required.

43
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,953
Let me go ahead and enter a value there for last name

44
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:42,203
and hit Submit.

45
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,583
Okay, that looks good, too, last name Smith.

46
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,713
That's cool, happy with that.

47
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,046
Now, let's break the system.

48
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,736
Let's simply enter whitespace.

49
00:01:56,903 --> 00:02:00,153
Really, just whitespace and hit submit.

50
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,520
What, that passed?

51
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,812
Whitespace passes the validation rules

52
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:07,730
and look at the bottom.

53
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,897
It's just whitespace, how?

54
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,989
How does whitespace pass validation?

55
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,656
We have @NotNull, we have @size.

56
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,005
So this is a common problem that new developers encounter

57
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:26,243
when they use Spring MVC validation.

58
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,322
It's not intuitive, it doesn't really make sense.

59
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:33,747
But don't worry, I'm gonna give you a solution for this.

60
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,164
And it's a proven technique.

61
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:38,025
It's a best practice that's using a Spring industry.

62
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,535
And it makes you some advanced features

63
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,691
and we see how it'll all play together.

64
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,375
And I'll cover that in the next set of videos.

65
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,233
So I have a solution, so stay tuned for next videos,

66
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,900
and we'll get it all worked out.
