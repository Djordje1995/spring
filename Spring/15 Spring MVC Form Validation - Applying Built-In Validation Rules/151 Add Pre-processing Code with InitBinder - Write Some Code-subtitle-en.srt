1
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:03,483
<v ->So let's go ahead and move and see the clips.</v>

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:06,345
We're going to go ahead and add support for Init Binder

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:08,639
and also that String Trimmer Editor.

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,655
Alright, so let's go ahead and move

5
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:13,822
into our customer controller class, expand the window here,

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,912
and let's go ahead and first off I'm just going to add

7
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:21,119
some comments here, just to kind of keep myself on track

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,286
just so I know what I'm doing here (laughs).

9
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,984
So basically, what I want to do is add Init Binder

10
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:38,759
to convert or trim the input strings.

11
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,174
I want to remove the leading or trailing white space

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,678
and also resolve this issue for our validation.

13
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,113
Alright, so I'm going to make use

14
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,046
of this at InitBinder annotation

15
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:52,213
that we've discussed in the previous set of slides

16
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,668
and then I'll simply give a method.

17
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:59,825
The method signature will always have Web Data Binder

18
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,158
being passed in.

19
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,801
And I'll just set up my curly braces, open and closed.

20
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,057
And now I'll do the similar thing as what I had

21
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:19,013 line:15% 
in the slides earlier, so I'll create this new

22
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,762 line:15% 
String Trimmer Editor, remember,

23
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:23,019 line:15% 
it's part of the new spring API.

24
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,898 line:15% 
I pass in the constructor value of true,

25
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:29,065 line:15% 
meaning that if it's all white space, trim it down to null.

26
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,289
And then what I'll do is I'll basically register

27
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:35,294
this custom editor on the data binder,

28
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:37,250
I'll say for the string class,

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,360
then make use of this string trimmer editor

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,027
that I just created.

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,188
And, uh, let me just kinda go through here

32
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,438
and fix my imports here for Init Binder

33
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,707
and a similar thing here for Web Data Binder

34
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:56,374
that's also from the spring API.

35
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:02,072
And finally String Trimmer Editor from the spring API.

36
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:07,500
Alrighty, that looks good and oh, have a little typo here.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,966
Oh, yeah, I got it. Have to fix the variable name.

38
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:12,076
It's data binder coming in as a param,

39
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:14,578
I need it to say data binder here on line 27.

40
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:16,623
Alrighty, got that taken care of,

41
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:18,597
and let's see, register, customer, ah,

42
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,764
this should be register custom editor,

43
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:26,801
not customer but custom, so I'll fix this little typo.

44
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:32,237
I'm thinking about too many customers here.

45
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:35,247
Alright, so register custom editor.

46
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:37,343
Alright, take care of that, and we're good.

47
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,299
Alright, so that takes care of all of the errors

48
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,049
that I had here on the actual code, good job.

49
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,864 line:15% 
Alright, so again, just kinda stepping back here.

50
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:53,578 line:15% 
So this is our Init Binder, this method will be called

51
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:56,845 line:15% 
for every web request coming into our controller

52
00:02:56,845 --> 00:03:01,047 line:15% 
and then we simply use this to trim the strings,

53
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,708
the leading and trailing space

54
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,857
and help us resolve that issue.

55
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,658
Alright, so let's go ahead and test this out.

56
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:10,853
Let's go ahead and do a run as and do run on server.

57
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,903
And then we'll bring it, we'll go to our customer form

58
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,550
again, we'll try and break it, we'll enter all white space

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,453
here for the name, so enter all white spaces and hit submit.

60
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:26,195
And, hm, it's working but that's not the error message

61
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,495
that I was expecting.

62
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:31,065
Here it says "may not be null," I was actually expecting

63
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:34,644
the one using the words "is required."

64
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:36,561
Hm, we're almost there,

65
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,575
let's think about this for one second.

66
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:44,081
Oh yeah, that's right, okay, remember my customer dot java

67
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:46,287
I said I was going to come back to if there was something

68
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,558
that I didn't really follow totally?

69
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:50,011
That's the at null.

70
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,875
Remember that from the previous videos?

71
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,920
So we actually need to give a message here.

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,057
Message is required, 'cuz what we saw on the screen

73
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,235
previously, that was the, on the form output,

74
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:04,680
that was the default message and here I'm giving my own

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,422
custom message of "is required."

76
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:09,489
So save that, my server did a reload on that

77
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,801
application of that context, now if I go back to this form

78
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,718
again, and just do a refresh on it,

79
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:22,148
and again let's try to break it by entering all white space.

80
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,727
Then, oh yeah, so this is great,

81
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,111
so we're getting our desired error message,

82
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,003
and also note here in the bottom, last name of null

83
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:36,170
it's trimming it all to null, so validation is working.

84
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,910
As desired.

85
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,667
All right, let's try one more thing.

86
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,591
Let's go ahead and enter a name and let's add a whole lot

87
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:46,766
of white space to the end and see if it actually trims it.

88
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:51,355
So I'll do a submit, and nice, now all that extra

89
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:54,876
white space has been trimmed from the end of that last name.

90
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:57,615
So this is great, so our string trimmer editor

91
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,516
is working as desired

92
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,727
and I'm really, really happy that it helped us to resolve

93
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:06,600
that crazy issue so I'd like to say congratulations

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,683
and good job!
