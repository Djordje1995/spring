1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:01,308
<v Darby>All right.</v>

2
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:02,723
So let's go ahead and dive in here.

3
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:05,078
Just a quick review of our development process.

4
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:07,453
So the first thing that we wanna do in this video

5
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:11,536
is add the validation rule to our customer class.

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,548 line:15% 
Moving into Eclipse, first thing I need to do

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:18,211 line:15% 
is write the code for the Customer class,

8
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,970 line:15% 
'cause I don't have a Customer class yet.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,696 line:15% 
So let's go ahead and create this new class.

10
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,049
So I'll just do a right click.

11
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,716
I'll say New, Class.

12
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,378
And the name that I'll give for the class is Customer

13
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:40,889
I'll keep all the other defaults, and then I'll hit Finish.

14
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:42,838
Excellent.

15
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:44,482
So we have this empty class right now.

16
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,255
I'll expand my window here.

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,812
Now, this is gonna be really simple.

18
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,044
We're simply gonna have two fields,

19
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:52,127
first name and last name.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,808
And I also wanna add

21
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,480
some getter and setter methods here for these properties.

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,472
So I'll simply just do a right click,

23
00:01:03,472 --> 00:01:07,444
and I'll say Source, Generate Getters and Setters.

24
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:09,266
And you've seen all this before, right?

25
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:13,433
You're accustomed to all of my tips, tricks, and techniques.

26
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,505
All right.

27
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:17,463
Zoom in here.

28
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:19,196
We'll go ahead and select both of those

29
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,211
for firstName and lastName

30
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,837
Or if you wanted to get really fancy,

31
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,201
you could hit the Select All button

32
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,175
in the top right, but it's up to you.

33
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:29,454
Anyways, we're here and we hit the OK button.

34
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,287
All right. Great.

35
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,253
So there's the code that Eclipse just generated for us,

36
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:36,420
the getters and setters for firstName and lastName

37
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,274
All right.

38
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:39,461
So now for the real work here,

39
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:41,993
that's actually adding the validation rules.

40
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,710
So we're gonna add a validation rule for lastName

41
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,952
So we're gonna say @NotNull

42
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:50,440
and then we give the actual message for this error.

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,281
And I actually misspoke in my previous video.

44
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:55,238
I called it @Null, but it's really @NotNull

45
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,758
But you already knew that, right?

46
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:58,290
And then we'll also give the annotation here

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,027
for @Size(min=1)

48
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,311
So those are the validation rules

49
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,739
that we'll have here for this field.

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,906
I'll go through and just fix the imports for @NotNull

51
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,358
And I'll also fix the import for @Size

52
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:19,458
And then I'll just scroll up to the top

53
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,446
and just make sure that my imports are correct.

54
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,279
So make sure you have

55
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:26,446
the javax.validation.constraints.NotNull and Size.

56
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,555
So this looks pretty good so far,

57
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:32,213
so we have the basic validation rules added

58
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:34,130
to this Customer class.
