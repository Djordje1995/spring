1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:01,683
<v Darby>Alrighty, so just a quick recap.</v>

2
00:00:01,683 --> 00:00:02,833
So we've covered step one

3
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,872
of creating a custom validation

4
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,391
where that includes our annotation

5
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,232
and our constraint validators.

6
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:12,060
So that was all the real heavy lifting here.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,607
The remaining steps we've kinda seen a lot of this before,

8
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:16,416
so step two will simply add

9
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,825
the validation rules to the class.

10
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:22,099
Step three is displaying the error message on the form

11
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,398
and then step four is simply updating the confirmation page.

12
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,826
These steps go really quickly

13
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,993
and we'll take care of all of these in this video.

14
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,344
So with step two,

15
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:36,301
adding a validation rule to the customer class.

16
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,134
So at this point,

17
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,744
we simply need to open up our customer class,

18
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:40,916
our entity,

19
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,470
and actually place the rule there.

20
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,173
So go down into to my customer.java file,

21
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,090
open it up.

22
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:53,718
And this is where we have all of our other validation rules

23
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,407
for like first name, last name, and so on.

24
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:59,368 line:15% 
Well first need to create a
(laughs)

25
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:01,664 line:15% 
I need to create a field here for course code.

26
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:02,790 line:15% 
So I'll just create a field,

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,662 line:15% 
private string course code,

28
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:08,730 line:15% 
and this field we can give any name, right,

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,940
which is course code.

30
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,497
And then we'll also generate some getters

31
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:15,265
and setters here for this field.

32
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,791
But again, this field could be called anything,

33
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,874
food bar or whatever you would like to have here.

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,617
So I'll just generate the getters and setters

35
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,688
using our normal technique.

36
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:27,762
Select everything there for course code

37
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,429
and then click okay.

38
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:35,138
Okay, great, so there we go.

39
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,954
So we have those

40
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,176
getters and setters here for course code.

41
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,176
Okay, good stuff so far.

42
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,426
Alright, so now let's go ahead and do the real work.

43
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:50,093
Let's drop in our custom annotation, woohoo!

44
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,506
So @CourseCode,

45
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:54,361
and remember, Java's case sensitive, right?

46
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,556
So this is a capital c,

47
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,593
so it's different from the other stuff

48
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,050
and this is our custom annotation

49
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,994
and wow!

50
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,322
The clips found our annotation.

51
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,054
So we can do an import on course code, yeah.

52
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:07,602
All right, so that's my annotation

53
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,123
that I just did an import on

54
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:12,898
and just verify and there it is for my validation package.

55
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,176
Course code, yeah baby,

56
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,259
using my custom validation over here.

57
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,467
And there you go and that's our @CourseCode annotation

58
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:25,351
We're not not gonna pass any attribute values here,

59
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,251
we're simply gonna use the defaults right

60
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,598
'cause we've already coded it accordingly

61
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,301
to handle the appropriate defaults.

62
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:35,014
So we're in good shape with this so far.

63
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:35,949
All right.

64
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:39,186
Now I need to display the error messages on the HTML form.

65
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,180
That's step three.

66
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,018
So I need to go into my customer-form.jsp

67
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:44,916
and again,

68
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,180
just follow the same process I've done before

69
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,333
for displaying the error messages.

70
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,564
So I actually need to add a new field

71
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:52,716
here for course code,

72
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:55,748
So I'm just gonna copy postal code

73
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:58,381
and I'll just do a little copy paste exercise

74
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,906
and drop postal code here,

75
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:05,073
but I'll go through and rename this to course code.

76
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,494
So, course code.

77
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,654
Path, course code.

78
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,698
All right, there we go.

79
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:19,324 line:15% 
So we have our new form field

80
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,324 line:15% 
and we also have on line 39 an entry

81
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,581 line:15% 
so we can actually display the error message

82
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:29,248 line:15% 
in case the validation fails for this field.

83
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,302 line:15% 
Now moving ahead to step four,

84
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,749 line:15% 
updating our confirmation page,

85
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,357 line:15% 
we simply wanna echo whatever the value user entered.

86
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,986 line:15% 
So, real simple right?

87
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:45,149
So again, I'll just do another little copy paste here.

88
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,316
And I will say

89
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:49,541
course code

90
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,003
and a dollar sign customer

91
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,336
dot course code.

92
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,543
Go and save that and there we go.

93
00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:58,864
So we'll just echo whatever the you user

94
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,639
entered on their HTML form.

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,889
Okay, good job.
