1
00:00:01,256 --> 00:00:02,773
<v Darby>All right, so we have the basic stub</v>

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:04,177
for our annotation setup.

3
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:07,611
Now what I need to do is actually define the attributes

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:10,845
that we can pass into our annotation.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,664
So we've already saw the usage example

6
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,783
where we're gonna have two attributes, one for value,

7
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,394
and one for the actual error message.

8
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,995
We'll actually define these attributes here,

9
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:25,162
and we'll also set up some default values for them.

10
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,174
And then we'll also make use of two other entries here

11
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:34,769
for this annotation for groups and also for payloads,

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,178
so groups is where you can actually group validation

13
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,614
constraints together, and then payload is where you can

14
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:43,781
give additional information about the validation error.

15
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,529
All right, so that's kinda like the basic layout here

16
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,256
of things that we need to do

17
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:51,860
and things that we need to fill in.

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,693
So let's start typing.

19
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,927
So, we're gonna have this one attribute called value

20
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,183
that the user can pass in, and if they don't

21
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:03,802
pass in a value, then we'll say the default is LUV.

22
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,954
So that's the actual prefix that we'll validate against.

23
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:09,300
Then also for message, they can pass in their own

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,838
custom message, but if not, then we'll give

25
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:16,668
this default error message of "must start with LUV."

26
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:17,513
This is primarily for people

27
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:20,967
who are using the actual annotation.

28
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,171
Then we set up our default groups, and so here,

29
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:26,372
we're not gonna use any grouping of grouping constraints,

30
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:30,082
so we'll simply just give the basic boilerplate here of

31
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:34,249
groups, and we'll simply just give an empty collection.

32
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,742
And then for payloads, we're not gonna use any payloads,

33
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:41,909
so we'll simply just give the default here for payload.

34
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:45,757
And again, payload can basically give you additional details

35
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:49,257
about the error message that has occurred.

36
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,560
So again, just anything will do.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,478
All right, so that's the basic layout here.

38
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,419
Let me go through and, let's see,

39
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,249
I have a small little typo here.

40
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,717
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm missing the parens here.

41
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:00,656
I'm missing parens.

42
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:02,739
There we go, there we go.

43
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:05,757
Let me go ahead and put the open paren,

44
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:07,070
close paren right there.

45
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,224
All-righty.

46
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:12,209
And then a similar thing here for the word payload,

47
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,126
lowercase, open paren, close paren.

48
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:17,630
All right, good.

49
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,463
Took care of that.

50
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:21,257
Let me go through and fix some of these imports here

51
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:23,174
for payload, just to import.

52
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:27,007
Make sure you perform the correct import here.

53
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,290
All right, so this looks pretty good.

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,943
We got all of the big items here,

55
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:39,313
a javax.validation.Payload, we got that importing correctly,

56
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:41,912
and we went through and we listed the attributes

57
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,763
that the user can call or pass in

58
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,416
to this given annotation.

59
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,632
So we're in good shape.

60
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,443
So we went through and defined the default course code,

61
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:52,022
error message, and then also groups and payloads,

62
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,715
and so the two key things that we're gonna use

63
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,619
in this demo is that we're gonna make use of the actual

64
00:02:56,619 --> 00:03:00,786
value for course code and a message for error messages.
