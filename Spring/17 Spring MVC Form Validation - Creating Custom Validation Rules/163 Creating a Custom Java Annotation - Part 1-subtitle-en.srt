1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,214
<v Darby>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:04,377
and dive into Eclipse here.

3
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:06,662
The first thing we're gonna do is our step 1A,

4
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:09,662
creating the @CourseCode annotation.

5
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,756
So I move over here to my project,

6
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:17,842
and I move down to the Java Resources directory,

7
00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:20,509
on the source, and I'm actually gonna create

8
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:21,869
a package first.

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,521
So I'll simply right-click over here

10
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,009
and I'll say new package.

11
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:25,882
Because I want to kind of group

12
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:29,882
all my validation code in the same package here.

13
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,333
And I'll pretty much keep the same package structure.

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,328
I'll just say .validation.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,245
So the full name here, .validation.

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,099
And once you're happy with that,

17
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:44,115
go ahead and click on the finish button.

18
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,552
Okay, great, now I have my validation package set up.

19
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:48,865
Now I need to add something to it, right?

20
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,870
So the first thing we're gonna do is add a new annotation.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,452
Ooh, this is new, haven't done this before.

22
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,702
New Annotation.

23
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:04,383
So this will bring up the annotation dialog here

24
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:06,778
and you basically give the name of the annotation.

25
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:09,802
So our annotation is called CourseCode.

26
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,799
And that's the value that we'll enter there.

27
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,479
We'll keep all the other defaults here

28
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,479
and we will click the finish button.

29
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,474
Great, so notice here, Eclipse helped us out

30
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,657
by setting up our annotation note on line three

31
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:25,825
to have public @interface, right, that special notation,

32
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,658
@interface CourseCode.

33
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,083
All right, so this is the basics here.

34
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,718
So we need to set up some annotations

35
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,050
at the top of this annotation.

36
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,548
Somewhat recursive, huh?

37
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:39,725
All right, so we'll say @Constraint(validatedBy

38
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,626
and then we give the actually class

39
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,520
that's gonna be our constraint validator.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,203
So we'll have a CourseCodeConstraintValidator

41
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,506
that we'll create in some later videos,

42
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:51,427
part of our step 1B.

43
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:53,927
And we give the .class for it.

44
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,831
And then we'll kind of scroll over here to the left

45
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:03,091
and we'll fix the import here for @Constraint.

46
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:06,114
That's out of the JavaX.validation package.

47
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,794
And we'll continue to have that little issue

48
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,924
on line five, just kind of leave it there for now.

49
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:12,431
We'll cover that in the following video, so don't worry,

50
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,823
don't fret right now.

51
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,752
Then we'll also say @Target.

52
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,740
Basically we're saying, hey, where can you apply

53
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,161
this new annotation that we're creating?

54
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,615
So here we'll say you can apply this annotation

55
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:26,144
on methods or you could also

56
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:28,811
apply this annotation on fields.

57
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,288
And so in our case, we basically want to apply it

58
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,519
to the field on our instance class

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,093
for doing our validation or a method.

60
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,426
So there it goes, that's the basics there,

61
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,370
and you can always go into the Java doc

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,761
and find all the other options available here.

63
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,297
But we'll just keep it simple for now.

64
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,310
So that's target, we'll do an import on target.

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,753
And then we'll do a similar thing for @Retention.

66
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:55,763
So this basically says, how long will the marked annotation

67
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,865
be stored or used?

68
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:02,310
So here we'll say the RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME.

69
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,219
So basically we say retain this annotation

70
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,386
in the byte code and also use it at RUNTIME by the JVL.

71
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:15,326
So we say at RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME.

72
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,538
All right, so that's kinda the basics here

73
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:23,269
for our annotation, so we have our imports up top,

74
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,770
we have everything taken care of.

75
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,144
Except for our validator class,

76
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:31,311
and we'll actually take care of that in the next video.
