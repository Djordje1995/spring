00:00:01,181 --> 00:00:02,261
<v Darby>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:04,754
we're gonna learn how to perform custom validation

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,087
with Spring MVC.

4
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:12,032
So let me give you a quick demo here

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,657
of the custom validation.

6
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:16,723
So we're gonna have a form that has three fields

7
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:19,039
for first name, last name, and course code.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,210
So I can go in and enter the first name, last name,

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,525
and a course code.

10
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:25,534
The course code is simply an identifier for a course.

11
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:28,434
Now we're gonna attach a custom business rule here

12
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:29,457
to this course code.

13
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:32,467
So if I hit Submit, notice it gives a validation error.

14
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,522
It says, "The course code must start with LUV,"

15
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,472
because we love to code.

16
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:39,787
So that's the custom business rule

17
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:42,366
that we're adding here for this course identifier.

18
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:43,379
So you'd have to go back

19
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,199
and add a course code that starts with LUV,

20
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,294
and then everything will work out just fine

21
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:49,756
when we hit the Submit button.

22
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:50,714
So this is great.

23
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,681
So notice our course code, and it starts with LUV.

24
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,472
That's our custom business rule that we just made up.

25
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,182
So I'll actually show you

26
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,959
how to write the code behind the scenes

27
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:04,190
that will allow Spring to perform the validation

28
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,169
using your own custom validation rule

29
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:10,002
or your own custom business logic.

30
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:16,210
So, with the custom validation,

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,674
as I mentioned, we're gonna create

32
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,946
our own custom business rule here.

33
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,240
So in our example,

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,772
the course code must start with LUV for Luv2Code.

35
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:26,991
And what we're gonna do,

36
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:30,255
Spring will actually call our custom validation rule,

37
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,208
and if there's an error,

38
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,281
then it will actually display it on the page.

39
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,504
So this custom validation is gonna return

40
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:38,704
a Boolean value of true or false

41
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:42,871
based on the code that the user entered on the form.

42
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,046
Alrighty.

43
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,652
So we'll actually do something really fun here.

44
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,686
We're gonna create a custom Java annotation from scratch.

45
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,817
So far, you've used some of the predefined validation rules

46
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:58,592
like @Min, @Max, but what we're gonna do here is

47
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:03,485
we're actually gonna create our own custom Java annotation,

48
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:06,484
and our custom annotation is gonna be called CourseCode.

49
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:09,438
So this is really some advanced Spring MVC work,

50
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:11,975
so you're in for a real treat in this video.

51
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,771
And as you can tell, I'm really excited

52
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,333
'cause this is some great stuff here.

53
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,452
So @CourseCode, this is a validation rule

54
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:21,952
that will actually apply to a given field.

55
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:26,007
So we'll have this field in our entity.

56
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,769
We'll call this field courseCode lowercase,

57
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,685
and then we'll add this annotation, @CourseCode

58
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,490
That's the custom annotation that we're gonna create.

59
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,762
This annotation, we can give it any name.

60
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:40,679
We can call it @FooBar, @Luv2Code, @CrazyStuff.

61
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,794
Any name you can give to this annotation.

62
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,216
This annotation is gonna take in two parameters here.

63
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:48,049
It's gonna take in

64
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,718
the actual value that I'm gonna start with

65
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,054
and then the actual error message

66
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,039
that's displayed on the HTML form.

67
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,957
And it's kind of parameterized right now,

68
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,497
but I'll show you how to write

69
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:59,542
all of the code for this annotation from scratch.

70
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,661
So again, a custom annotation

71
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,396
that we're gonna create ourselves,

72
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:05,995
some good, advanced material.

73
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,712
Now, we always have our step by step process for it.

74
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,701
So the first thing is creating the custom validation rule.

75
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,753
The second step is adding that rule to the customer class.

76
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:17,722
Then we display the messages to the HTML form.

77
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,797
And then we update our confirmation page.

78
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,216
So steps two through four,

79
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,313
you've done that many times before.

80
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:26,171
We're simply gonna focus on step number one,

81
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,251
creating that custom validation rule.

82
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,175
So I'll go ahead and drill down here

83
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,925
step by step on number one, creating the rule.

84
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:38,487
So step 1A is we have to create that CourseCode annotation,

85
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,266
creating it from scratch.

86
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:45,014
And then we need to create the CourseCodeConstraintValidator

87
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:48,205
This is where we'll actually place our own validation logic

88
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:52,409
or our own business rules to determine true or false

89
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,716
if the value passed in passes our validation.

90
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:59,633
So that's where we'll put our own custom logic.
