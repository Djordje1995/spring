1
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,477 line:15% 
<v Darby>Okay so I'm getting really anxious here.</v>

2
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,953 line:15% 
I'm eager to run this application,

3
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:12,703 line:15% 
so let's go ahead and run it and test it out.

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,526
Go ahead and click my link here for customer form.

5
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:25,934
And I'll just go ahead and enter some data here,

6
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,936
for a last name.

7
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:30,353
Also, go and submit and whoa!

8
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:34,273
What the what?

9
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:36,356
I was not expecting this.

10
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:40,301
500 error, let's dig in here.

11
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,734
So this was unplanned, unscripted,

12
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:46,639
but here, root cause, Null Pointer Exception.

13
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:47,806
Oh, I like it.

14
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:52,127
So this is some good debugging tips for you.

15
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:55,877
And Course Code Constraint Validator line 20.

16
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,147
Okay, all right.

17
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,389
We're getting some evidence here.

18
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,965
Let's get on the trail.

19
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:10,715
So, course code constraint validator line 20.

20
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:18,660
Well I didn't follow my own code.

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,743
So I actually need to check for null.

22
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:24,880
So what happens is that if the user

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,043
doesn't enter anything, it comes in

24
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,256
as a null value for the code.

25
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,569
And, boom, blows up right here.

26
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,104
Oh boy, okay.

27
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,030
So we can fix it, right?

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,329
We know how to fix it.

29
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,005
We just need to check for null

30
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,422
before we do any real checks.

31
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,131
This is all fun.

32
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:48,192
So, here I can say, if the code is not equal to null,

33
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,251
then I can do my regular work,

34
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:53,834
like I planned on doing, silly.

35
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,993
So I'll say, result equals this thing

36
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,982
and I put the curly brace.

37
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:06,149
And then else, I'll actually return the value of true.

38
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,779
Because, hey, you didn't pass anything

39
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,841
there's nothing for me to validate.

40
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,280
And we'll let you go on.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,782
Because this field is not required.

42
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:19,194
So, all righty, I think I feel a little bit better.

43
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:21,230
And again, it's all my fault.

44
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,738
I should have followed my own code from my own slides.

45
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:27,738
But hey, we're human, things happen.

46
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,142
All righty, so we're having too much fun here.

47
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:32,542
So anyway, we fix our code.

48
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:33,982
We've saved it.

49
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:37,204
Now let's go back and actually run this

50
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,782
and try it again.

51
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:41,281
So get it up and running.

52
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,031
We click on our form.

53
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:47,432
And now we enter some data here for last name.

54
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,481
And then hit the submit.

55
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,719
Okay, it goes through, good!

56
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,381
Okay, so no Null Pointer Exception, that's a good thing.

57
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,768
Now let's actually enter a code.

58
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:58,505
Let's enter a bad code, like, A-B-C one two three

59
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,856
and this should fail.

60
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:02,828
And yeah, all right!

61
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:06,719
So it says that it must start with L-U-V.

62
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,989
Good job.

63
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,393
So now here I'll say, "Okay, great.

64
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:10,869
"I'll start it with L-U-V."

65
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:13,017
and hit enter, and booya!

66
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,432
There we go.

67
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,430
Course Code LUV one two three.

68
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,756
So that's great.

69
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,205
So we're in really, really good shape here.

70
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,241
Now, what I wanna do is actually customize this.

71
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,944
Such that it's not using L-U-V

72
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:28,107
but instead, using something different.

73
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,344
A different code.

74
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,466
So here I'll customize it by saying,

75
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,383
"must start with TOPS."

76
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:36,179
Again, just making this up.

77
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,693
We could say, "must start with Foobar."

78
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:41,255
Or, "must start with funny."

79
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,181
Whatever, but I'm just getting a customized

80
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:47,056
version of this annotation and making use of it.

81
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,756
So I'll let my container go through,

82
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,591
in the background, and reload.

83
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:52,730
And notice here at the bottom, it will say,

84
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,592
"Hey, the reload is completed."

85
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,767
Okay, good.

86
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:59,120
So now I should be able to go back to my form.

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,416
All righty, so for my course code here

88
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,942
I'll just enter some bad data, like A-B-C one two three,

89
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,480
hit submit, right?

90
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay, and up at the top it's asking

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,893
about names, Smith.

92
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,378
All right, or whatever.

93
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:11,082
And here, let me just give a bad code again,

94
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:13,427
L-U-V one two three.

95
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,481
I'm gonna try and hit submit.

96
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,905
Notice here it's saying it must start with TOPS.

97
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,279
Because we've changed our source code now

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,530
to actually validate against this new prefix.

99
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,194
Okay, good, so I'll go ahead and hit

100
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,055
TOPS one two three, hit submit.

101
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,905
And, boom, it passed.

102
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:29,157
So that's cool.

103
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,105
So we have our annotation up and running.

104
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,742
We can even customize our annotation

105
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:35,805
as far as what code or prefix to use.

106
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,303
And it all works out fine with the

107
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:39,932
Spring MVC Validation.

108
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,895
Good job, congrats!

109
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:42,728
Whooo!
