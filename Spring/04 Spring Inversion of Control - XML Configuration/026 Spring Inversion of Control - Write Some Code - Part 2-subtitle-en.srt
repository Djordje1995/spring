1
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:03,719
<v Instructor>Alright, so we met the requirements</v>

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,598
but our boss said I'd like to see you test that out,

3
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:08,407
let's change the configuration file

4
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:11,097
and let's put in a different implementation.

5
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:11,930
They just wanna make sure

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,568
that the code actually works as advertised.

7
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:16,497
Alright, no problem.

8
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:18,952
So, here let me open up my Spring config file,

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,850
I'll move in here.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,603
Right now it has a TrackCoach that it's using

11
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:26,564
and I want to change this over to use BaseballCoach, right?

12
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:30,092
So, I'll replace TrackCoach with BaseballCoach.

13
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:31,665
It's all configurable

14
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,286
and then once I have that set up

15
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:36,786
as BaseballCoach, I simply save this file.

16
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,417
And so, once the file is saved,

17
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,382
I move over to my app again

18
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,556
and I simply run it.

19
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,584
No need to change the source code here

20
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,527
because it's reading everything from the configuration file.

21
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,108
So, I just say right click, choose run as

22
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,322
and run it as a job application.

23
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,498
And boo yaka, boo yaka.

24
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:58,516
(instructor laughs)

25
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,593
So, now our BaseballCoach implementation is running.

26
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:04,391
Based on information from the config file,

27
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,154
our BaseballCoach says hey,

28
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:09,749
spend 30 minutes on batting practice.

29
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:11,940
So, this is really good, so we've met the requirements here.

30
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,362
Our app's configurable,

31
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,304
simply change the config file,

32
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,617
run it without modifying any source code

33
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:19,395
and it'll pick up the new implementation.

34
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:23,000
So, again job well done, drop the mic

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,770
and you can go ahead and head home for the day

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,489
'cause you accomplished a lot of great stuff here.

37
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,989
Alright, good job.
