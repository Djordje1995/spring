1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:02,977
<v Instructor>Alright, so moving into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,977 --> 00:00:05,155
we're gonna go ahead and write some code,

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:08,452
so we'll make use of the existing project that we've had,

4
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:11,468
spring-demo-one and this is the same project

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,702
that we had in our previous videos

6
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:14,303
as far as making use of our coach,

7
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:15,608
baseball coach and track coach,

8
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:18,358
so again, the same project there.

9
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,086
And what we wanna do is make use of some code

10
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:24,950
that we've downloaded for this course,

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,723
so in previous videos we gave you the links

12
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:29,755
on how to download the course files.

13
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:31,280
So, once you download it you'll get

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,228
this spring-hibernate-source-code.zip,

15
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:36,407
you can extract it and then you'll get this folder,

16
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,691
so again, look at the previous videos in the course

17
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:42,099
as far as how to download the actual course zip file

18
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,737
but anyways, once you have it,

19
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:45,828
you've unzipped it,

20
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,944
there's this spring-hibernate-source-code

21
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,114
and we'll look in this directory here

22
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:50,843
called spring-core

23
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,227
because what we wanna do is actually copy a starter file

24
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:58,417
that'll help us out with the XML configurations.

25
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:01,303
So, I just move down into spring-demo-one starter file

26
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:04,637
and there's a file there called applicationContext.xml.

27
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:07,664
It's just a basic starter file, basic shell

28
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:09,752
but let's go ahead and copy this file,

29
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:12,919
just do a right click and choose copy,

30
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,465
and let's move back over to Eclipse

31
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,978
and we wanna place this in our source directory, alright?

32
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,313
So, highlight that source directory,

33
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,480
do a right click and then choose paste

34
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:26,470
because what this will actually do

35
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,777
it'll paste the file

36
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,619
and actually put it on our application's class path,

37
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,344
so we can make use of our class path applicationContext.

38
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,415
So, there's our file.

39
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:37,321
Now if we just double click this file,

40
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,784
our first step is configuring our Spring beans, alright?

41
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:44,090
So, this file has a lot of header information here

42
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,718
for the XML namespaces and that's what's required

43
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,983
for Spring to be able to process this file

44
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:53,547
using it's grammar, and XML schema,

45
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,498
and now let's go ahead and define our bean.

46
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:56,956
So, we have this bean,

47
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,682
and now I need to sep up two attributes.

48
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,724
The first attribute I need to set is ID equals

49
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:05,638
and this is basically our alias of what the app will use.

50
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:07,747
I'll just call it myCoach

51
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,435
and then I give class.

52
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:12,963
Now I give the fully qualified class name

53
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,529
of our implementation,

54
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:16,193
so in this case I want the BaseballCoach,

55
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:20,360
so I know that BaseballCoach is in com.Luv2code.springdemo.

56
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,615
Oh and actually this is TrackCoach, sorry.

57
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,058
So, com.Luv2code.springdemo.TrackCoach

58
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:30,542
and that's our bean definition there.

59
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,269
So, that pretty much covers step one

60
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,519
as far as configuring our Spring beans.

61
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:39,540
Alright, so now let's go ahead

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,373
and take a look at one other item,

63
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,980
and now what I'm gonna do is actually make use

64
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,317
of a Java class, so I'm gonna create a new class

65
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,150
called SpringHelloApp.

66
00:02:55,645 --> 00:03:00,279
So, I'll select my package here, I'll do a right click

67
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,196
and I'll say new class.

68
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,180
And the actual name of the class here,

69
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,263
I'll actually call it HelloSpringApp.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,394
And also I'll check the box here at the bottom,

71
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:19,879
public static void main,

72
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,014
just so it'll give us a main method for our application

73
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,400
and then I'll just hit the finish button.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,057
Okay, great, so again, just like before,

75
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:30,224
this gives us a very basic Java class.

76
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:34,791
Now what I'd like to do is, you know,

77
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,135
always like to put in comments for us

78
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,680
before I start writing code.

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,005
So, the first thing I wanna do here

80
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:42,172
is load the Spring configuration file.

81
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:46,526
And then actually wanna go ahead and retrieve a bean

82
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,693
from the Spring container.

83
00:03:50,151 --> 00:03:52,793
Now that I have the bean, then I call methods on the bean,

84
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:54,218
or a method on the bean

85
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:56,072
and then finally just to be nice,

86
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:59,852
I'll close the actual application context.

87
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,564
So, that's my basic game plan here

88
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:04,231
for building our HelloSpringApp.

89
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:09,304
Alright, so let me stretch out here at the bottom,

90
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,038
give myself some white space,

91
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,772
and now let's go ahead and cover step two

92
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:15,608
of creating a Spring container.

93
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:16,887
So, again here we're gonna use

94
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,150
this ClassPathXmlApplicationContext

95
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,539
and I say new and that's a really long name,

96
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,601
so I'm just gonna copy, paste that name.

97
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,528
I'm taking a shortcut, paste.

98
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,515
And then in the construct

99
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,619
I give the actual name of the config file,

100
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,701
so just like in the previous example here,

101
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:38,083
ApplicationContext.xml, that's the name

102
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,956
of our XML config file.

103
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,619
Now it'll give us error messages for us,

104
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,698
so we wanna import,

105
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,149
so we'll simply hover over that error message

106
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,782
and then we choose that first option of importing.

107
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,176
So, if you move up top,

108
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:52,121
Eclipse will help you out with importing

109
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:56,162
that class from the appropriate package,

110
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,500
so that's a nice little feature there.

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,667
Okay, so now let's retrieve the bean from the container.

112
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,074
So, here I say context.getBean

113
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,530
and I give myCoach, that's the ID,

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,592
comma Coach.class, that's the actual name

115
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,925
of the interface for our implementation.

116
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,665
So, now I'm simply gonna call methods on the bean,

117
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:22,011
so I simply use my system out print line trick,

118
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,284
sysout, control, space,

119
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:27,867
and then I'll say theCoach.getDailyWorkout.

120
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,971
And now I simply go through and close the context

121
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,703
by saying context.close,

122
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,870
just to be nice, just to clean up after ourselves.

123
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,385
Alright, so that's kind of the basic game plan here

124
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,571
with this HelloSpringApp.

125
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,404
So, the first thing we do

126
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:49,118
is we load the Spring configuration file,

127
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,469
then we go through and retrieve the bean

128
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,052
from the container.

129
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,621
Then I call methods on that bean,

130
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,329
and then finally I close the context

131
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,014
by doing my clean up,

132
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:01,537
and now that's the basic game plan.

133
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:04,214
And that's kinda your first Spring application right there.

134
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,047
Wohoo.

135
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,058
Now let's go ahead and try this out,

136
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:07,382
let's run it.

137
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:11,549
So, just do a right click, run as a Java application.

138
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,515
And there we go.

139
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,453
Booya, check the output.

140
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,794
So, here look at some of the info messages,

141
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,699
so it's loading XML bean definitions

142
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,136
from your class path resource,

143
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:22,822
that's our configuration file,

144
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,840
applicationContext.xml,

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,616
and then we called our sysout print line

146
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:28,394
on the getDailyWorkout,

147
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:30,370
and our TrackCoach said hey,

148
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,629
we need you to run a hard five K.

149
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,628
So, this looks really good.

150
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,757
Kinda excited about this.

151
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,219
I hope you are too.

152
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,378
This is our first real Spring application

153
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:43,267
and it actually works which is cool.

154
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,437
So again, there's the code up top

155
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,561
and then our messages being displayed there

156
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:51,653
at the bottom, reading a config file,

157
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:54,598
getting a bean from the container,

158
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,871
and then simply calling methods on that bean,

159
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,763
and that gives us the desired output in our console window.

160
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:00,596
Cool.

161
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,062
So, let me kind of switch back to our slides here

162
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:08,636
for a second because now we've kind of come

163
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,618
full circle here.

164
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,055
So, now we have an app that meets the requirements.

165
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,962
Our app is configurable

166
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,230
based on that configuration file

167
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,334
we just worked on

168
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,344
and also we can easily change the coach

169
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:21,576
for another sport by simply putting in

170
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,728
a different coach implementation.

171
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:27,118
So, I like to say mission accomplished,

172
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,460
and I'd like to say that we've met all of those requirements

173
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,877
from our manager.

174
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,262
So, hey boss, we got it all covered here.

175
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:35,334
We're all done for the day

176
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:39,781
and thanks to Spring our life is much easier.

177
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:40,929
So, good job here.

178
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:41,864
Our first Spring app,

179
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:44,169
it's up, it's running and it's working.

180
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,145
A lot of great Spring stuff coming on later

181
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,821
but hey, this is a good start,

182
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,286
so give yourself a pat on the back.

183
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:51,536
Job well done.
