1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,832
<v Instructor>Alright, let's dive into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:04,694
and let's write some code.

3
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:06,327 line:15% 
So what I wanna do is continue to use that

4
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:07,717 line:15% 
existing project that we created

5
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,615 line:15% 
in some of the previous videos.

6
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:13,635 line:15% 
And I'll start off by first creating a package.

7
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:15,569 line:15% 
So I'll just right click on the source directory.

8
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:17,319 line:15% 
I'll say new package.

9
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,426
And the name I'll give for the package here,

10
00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:25,509
I'll call it com.luv2code.springdemo.

11
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,954
'Cause we love to code.

12
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,013
And once you're happy with that,

13
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,937
we'll go ahead and hit the finish button.

14
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,573
Alright so we have this basic package.

15
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:37,130 line:15% 
Now the first thing I wanna do is create the

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,473 line:15% 
baseball coach.

17
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,412 line:15% 
So it's a simple pojo, or plain old java object,

18
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:45,245 line:15% 
so I'll do a right click, I'll say new, class.

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,106
For the name, I'll call it BaseballCoach.

20
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:54,193
And I'll keep all the other defaults here.

21
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:56,776
And I'll hit the finish button.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,193
Alright so here we go.

23
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:04,721
Our very basic class called BaseballCoach.

24
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,561
Let me go ahead and

25
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,235
zoom for a bit.

26
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,400 line:15% 
And I really wanna create just one method here.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,317 line:15% 
This one method will be called getDailyWorkout.

28
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,831 line:15% 
And it's gonna return a string.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,358
So here I'll say,

30
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,200
I dunno, makin' somethin' up here.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,760
I'll spend 30 minutes in the batting cage.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,393
Or spend 30 minutes on batting practice.

33
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,060
That's close enough.

34
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:36,762
So again, just a very simple implementation here

35
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,096
of this BaseballCoach for that method,

36
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,429
getDailyWorkout.

37
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,746
And then kinda just stepping back,

38
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,722 line:15% 
remember, we're building this little app

39
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,416 line:15% 
that's gonna talk to the baseball coach

40
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,436 line:15% 
and get daily workout

41
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:51,434 line:15% 
so we can kinda check the box there.

42
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:54,601 line:15% 
This baseball coach class is complete.

43
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,733 line:15% 
Alright, so let's move back over here

44
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,277 line:15% 
and let's go ahead and create another class here.

45
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:03,392 line:15% 
Let's go ahead and create the MyApp class.

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,475 line:15% 
So I just do a right click, and I say new, class.

47
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:12,777
The actual name I'll give for it is MyApp.

48
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:14,295
And then one thing I'll do here at the bottom

49
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:18,248
is that I'll check the box here to give us a main method.

50
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:23,116
This will be the main program for our application.

51
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,199
And then I'll hit finish.

52
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,698
Alright so here's our MyApp class,

53
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,198
has a main method.

54
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,660
Now I'll just go ahead and write some comments

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,937
as far as the type of work I wanna do.

56
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:41,819
So I say create the object

57
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,483
and then use the object.

58
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:46,150
Very simple, nothing fancy here.

59
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:49,983 line:15% 
So again, just putting in the little diagram,

60
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,387 line:15% 
so our app's gonna talk to the BaseballCoach.

61
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:54,466 line:15% 
So that means I need to create the Coach object.

62
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,633 line:15% 
So I need to say theCoach equals new BaseballCoach.

63
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,883 line:15% 
So at this point I have the object created

64
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:06,403 line:15% 
and that's theCoach that we created in a previous file.

65
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,922 line:15% 
Now I'll actually use it.

66
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,977 line:15% 
And I'll just do a print line here.

67
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:11,982 line:15% 
I'll make use of one of my sys out tricks.

68
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,763 line:15% 
I'll says sys out,

69
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:14,998 line:15% 
control space,

70
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,694 line:15% 
and that'll actually give me this system out print line.

71
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,835 line:15% 
Just a little Eclipse trick for you there.

72
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:22,402
And I'll say System out print line theCoach dot

73
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,044
getDailyWorkout,

74
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,729 line:15% 
'cause I wanna get the actual daily workout

75
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,812 line:15% 
that I need for practice.

76
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,997 line:15% 
And this kinda maps up with what we have here

77
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:32,367 line:15% 
with that little diagram.

78
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,249 line:15% 
So this looks good.

79
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,494 line:15% 
So we have theBaseballCoach taken care of.

80
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:39,134 line:15% 
And then we also have MyApp taken care of.

81
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:43,134
So then let's go ahead and run this application.

82
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,978
And we get the output,

83
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,951
Spend 30 minutes on batting practice.

84
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,918
And again, there's no rocket science here.

85
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,148
This is kinda Java 101.

86
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:56,024
We're creating objects and we're simply

87
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,494
calling methods on it.

88
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,911
So, hopefully you're okay with it so far.

89
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,887
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and get that idea

90
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:06,515
of the one requirement here that the app should work

91
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,353
with any type of coach.

92
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,604
So what we wanna do is make use of a software

93
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:11,997
engineering best practice

94
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,312
and that's to code to an interface.

95
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,590
So instead of coding directly to theBaseballCoach

96
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,961
implementation, we wanna make use of a well

97
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,961
defined interface that all coaches will support.

98
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,684 line:15% 
So, every coach is gonna have a method called

99
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:31,224 line:15% 
getDailyWorkout.

100
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:32,819 line:15% 
So let's go ahead and create this interface.

101
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,261 line:15% 
So we're kind of doing some code refactoring here.

102
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,754 line:15% 
I'll say right click, I'll say new,

103
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:40,337 line:15% 
and then I'll choose interface.

104
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,850
And the actual name of the interface I'll create,

105
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,433
I'll call it Coach.

106
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,195
And just a very simple interface

107
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,866
and I'll keep all the other defaults here

108
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,533
and I'll hit finish.

109
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,570 line:15% 
Alright, so, now we have this interface,

110
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,029 line:15% 
let's go ahead and add this one method,

111
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,675 line:15% 
getDailyWorkout and just a semicolon.

112
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:06,986 line:15% 
Now note here,

113
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:07,858 line:15% 
or recall,

114
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,249 line:15% 
an interface doesn't have any implementation code,

115
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,160 line:15% 
it's only a specification.

116
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,478 line:15% 
So they simply say, what is available

117
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,204 line:15% 
but not how it's implemented.

118
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,161 line:15% 
So the what portion of it is

119
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,581 line:15% 
a method called getDailyWorkout.

120
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,751 line:15% 
And then you'll have different coaches that'll implement

121
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:26,918 line:15% 
this method depending on the type of coach that they are.

122
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:30,984
Alright, so now let's go back to our BaseballCoach,

123
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,704 line:15% 
we need to do some refactoring here.

124
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:34,746 line:15% 
So, in our BaseballCoach we need to say

125
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:38,452 line:15% 
that our BaseballCoach implements Coach.

126
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,028 line:15% 
So that's that interface we just created.

127
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,541 line:15% 
And also add overrides,

128
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,836 line:15% 
meaning that this is the method that we override

129
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,601 line:15% 
from that coach interface.

130
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,119 line:15% 
So we're basically here just saying that our

131
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:51,131 line:15% 
BaseballCoach is compliant by implementing

132
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,246 line:15% 
a given Coach interface.

133
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:56,010 line:15% 
So I can access the BaseballCoach specifically,

134
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,722 line:15% 
or we can access it in a generic fashion

135
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,988
using the coach interface.

136
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,558 line:15% 
Alright, so let's make this small modification

137
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:04,004 line:15% 
here to MyApps.

138
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,444 line:15% 
So, I'm gonna change the variable on the left hand side,

139
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:09,132 line:15% 
so instead of BaseballCoach, the impletmentation,

140
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:12,687 line:15% 
I'm gonna say Coach, which is the interface.

141
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:14,008 line:15% 
Alright, so at this point,

142
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,833 line:15% 
we have theCoach which is just a generic interface

143
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,989 line:15% 
that has a method called getDailyWorkout.

144
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,070 line:15% 
So at this point

145
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,659 line:15% 
line eleven can work with any Coach implementation

146
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,535 line:15% 
that has the getDailyWorkout method.

147
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:32,508 line:15% 
Alright, so let's go ahead and run this application.

148
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,341
And wow!

149
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,025
Nothing really different here, right?

150
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,610
This is the same thing we saw before.

151
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,568
But again, the code's gonna run exactly the same,

152
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:41,799
however we've refactored the code

153
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,034
and we've refined it to make it a little bit better

154
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:47,098
to follow good software engineering practices.

155
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,914
And what we're gonna do in the next video,

156
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,170

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,778
implementations to follow that one requirement

158
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:56,040

159
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,159
types of coaches or different type of coach

160
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,414
implementations.
