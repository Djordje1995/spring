1
00:00:00,975 --> 00:00:02,451
<v Instructor>All right, so we have our app working</v>

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:03,618
with the BaseballCoach.

3
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:05,475
Now, let's go ahead and add that new requirement

4
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:07,902
of working with a different type of coach.

5
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,950
So in my MainApp.java program,

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,583
I'm gonna change it on the right-hand side,

7
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,108
so instead of new BaseballCoach,

8
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,525
I'm gonna say new TrackCoach.

9
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,066
So, TrackCoach.

10
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,166
But now, we don't have a TrackCoach class yet,

11
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,282
that's why we have the little red, squiggly underneath that.

12
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,166
And also, if we move over to the left-hand side

13
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,499
and we click on this little red x,

14
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,124
then Eclipse will give us some suggestions

15
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,957
and, hmm, interesting.

16
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:42,333
It can actually create the class TrackCoach for me.

17
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,500
Mm, I like it.

18
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,982
That's pretty cool.

19
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:47,728
Let's try it, so let's go and select this option,

20
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:49,841
Create class TrackCoach,

21
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,017
and then, wow, this is great.

22
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:54,090
So it has a name of TrackCoach

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,107
and also, hmm, they're even gonna implement

24
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,743
the interface for us, Coach,

25
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,425
that we have from the previous slide.

26
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:05,099
So this is looking pretty good here. (laughs)

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,933
So let's go ahead and click Finish,

28
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,275
and let's see what it does and

29
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,108
boo-yah,

30
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,745
Eclipse wrote some code for us.

31
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:14,650
This is awesome.

32
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,755
So they have the class TrackCoach,

33
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:18,158
implements Coach,

34
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,715
and they did the override for that one method,

35
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,797
getDailyWorkout.

36
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:25,973
Man, you gotta love that (laughs).

37
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,306
Thanks, Eclipse.

38
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:29,908
All right, so let's go ahead

39
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:32,524
and get rid of that auto-generated stub

40
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:35,366
and let's get rid of the null

41
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:38,763
and let's return our workout as a TrackCoach.

42
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,763
So we're gonna say, "Run a hard 5k."

43
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,082
All right, so our track coach,

44
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:45,865
they're gonna run us really hard,

45
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:49,175
get us into shape for the next track meet.

46
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,008
So there we go.

47
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:52,025
So we have the implementation for this setup,

48
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,541
so this is our new coach that we just created, TrackCoach,

49
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,374
implements Coach,

50
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:58,174
and we gave our custom implementation here

51
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,841
for getDailyWorkout.

52
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,522
So now, let me move back over to MyApp.java

53
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:09,991
and now this works out just fine.

54
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,457
We're in good shape.

55
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:14,277
So we have a new TrackCoach, that class has been created.

56
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:16,708
On the left-hand side, the assignments of theCoach interface

57
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,550
because that TrackCoach implements theCoach interface,

58
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,607
and will print it out.

59
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:22,483
So let's go ahead and run it.

60
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:25,815
So I'll just do a right-click, Run As, Java Application,

61
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:28,608
and then woo-hoo, "Run a hard 5k,"

62
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,033
so that's our TrackCoach giving us our daily workout.

63
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,407
This is pretty cool, I like it.

64
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,499
And then the nice thing about it

65
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:39,266
is that on line 11, we can handle any type of coach

66
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:42,699
because we, again, were coding to the interface,

67
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,616
not the implementation.

68
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,739
So, we're almost there

69
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,366
but again, this is a rough prototype.

70
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,917
It's not 100% yet.

71
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,025
And the reason it's not 100%

72
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:02,949
is that one of those requirements that we had,

73
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,175
one was that this should work with any type of coach

74
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,117
and we kind of handled that part of it

75
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,100
but the other requirement

76
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,800
was that the actual coach implementation

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,622
should be configurable

78
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:15,916
and that right now, it's not really configurable

79
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,216
because it's hardcoded right here.

80
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,356
Ideally, it will be great

81
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:24,900
if we could maybe read the actual implementation name

82
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,913
from a config file, and then make use of it,

83
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:29,899
so then we could easily swap

84
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:32,356
by only changing a config file

85
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:35,257
instead of having to change the source code.

86
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,159
So in the next video, we'll look at Spring

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,326
and Spring was designed to address this exact problem.
