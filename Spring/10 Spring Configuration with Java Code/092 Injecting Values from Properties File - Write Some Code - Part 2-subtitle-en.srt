1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,003
<v Instructor>Alright, so we're making</v>

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,422
really good progress here.

3
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:05,849
So in step three we're actually gonna reference

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,315
the values from the properties file.

5
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,642
So I'll move over to my SwimCoach class.

6
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,559
Expand the window here.

7
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,469
And basically what I wanna do is define two fields.

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,079
And inject them accordingly.

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,825
So here I'll set up my first field for email

10
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,658
and then my second field for team.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,216
And then just like what we saw in the slides

12
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:32,437
we make use of that @value annotation to inject

13
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:34,835
the actual value from the properties file.

14
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,390
And we place that inside a dollar sign curly brace

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,983
and we give the property name of foo.email.

16
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,583
Let me go ahead and fix the imports here

17
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,709
for @value annotation.

18
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:45,836
So that looks good.

19
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,671
And so there you go so right here foo.email

20
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,396
that's the actual property name from the actual config file

21
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:53,313
or the properties file.

22
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:58,683
And it will basically inject that value into our field here

23
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,686
called email.

24
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,436
So this is field level injection.

25
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,717
Now let's do a similar process here for team.

26
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:08,969
So again make use of the property name

27
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,886
inside the dollar sign curly brace so foo.team.

28
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,407
And again it injects it into the actual field called team.

29
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,040
So there we are, so we're in good shape right now.

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,873
So this looks really, really good.

31
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:28,839
Now let's go ahead and modify this coach class

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,443
this swim coach class will actually make use of

33
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,353
those new fields here.

34
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:36,288
So what I'm gonna do here is actually generate some

35
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,538
getter methods.

36
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:41,052
So I'll simply do a right-click Source,

37
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:42,895
generate getter setters.

38
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,430
And I'll expand the options here.

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,613
I simply wanna expose or generate getter methods

40
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:52,779
so I wanna generate a get email and also a get team.

41
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,667
We could manually write it out if we wanted to

42
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,795
but here just making use of Eclipse to help me out.

43
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,821
Select those options, hit OK.

44
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,171
And then there we go, so good.

45
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,535
So lines 29 through 35 these are the new methods

46
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,315
that were just generated by Eclipse

47
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,618
to give us the values for email and team.

48
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,368
So this is great, I'm happy with this so far.

49
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:16,715
Alright so I'll go ahead and save this.

50
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:19,660
And let me scroll back just take a look at everything,

51
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,243
so this looks good.

52
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:26,113
Alright, so I think we're good to go here.

53
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,494
Alright so let's go ahead

54
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,499
and move into our SwimJavaConfigDemo App.

55
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:37,985
This is our main program.

56
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,210
We're gonna make some slight modifications

57
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,710
here in this file.

58
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,389
The first mod I wanna make is on line 14.

59
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,813
I wanna change the actual class here to SwimCoach.

60
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,669
Because I wanna make use of the special methods

61
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:54,293
that I just added to SwimCoach the get team

62
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,002
and the get email make the changes here accordingly

63
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,602
on the left hand side and also on the right hand side.

64
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,910
Because SwimCoach has new methods that are not available

65
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,128
in the normal Coach interface, and that's the get email

66
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:06,737
and get team method.

67
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,941
Alright so now down here at the bottom we simply

68
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,293
go ahead and make use of our new methods.

69
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:13,376
Take it for a test drive.

70
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,229
And these new methods is gonna make use

71
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,594
of those property values that were actually injected

72
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,652
into that SwimCoach class from the Props file.

73
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:36,900
Alright so system out print line.

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,567
I'll simply print out the email.

75
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:45,511
So theCoach.getEmail.

76
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,590
And I'll simply do a copy, paste here.

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,210
And I'll do a similar thing for the team.

78
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,235
So line 24 I simply say team

79
00:03:57,235 --> 00:04:00,095
and then I say theCoach.getTeam.

80
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:01,570
So again we're making use of those new methods

81
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,540
that are available in the SwimCoach class.

82
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,901
So this looks pretty good so far.

83
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,474
So this is great, I'm kind of excited about this.

84
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:10,224
I'm anxious, I'm ready to run it.

85
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,446
Alright so we save everything.

86
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:21,359
We right-click and choose Run As, Java Application.

87
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,991
Let's run it.

88
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,665
Oh and this looks good.

89
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,973
I'm getting excited, I'm getting happy.

90
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,066
Look at that, email myeasycoach@luv2code.com.

91
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:32,530
And team Awesome Java Coders.

92
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,230
And it's reading all that information

93
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,332
from the properties file.

94
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,694
So we're actually injecting data from the Props file

95
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,674
into our Java class, love it.

96
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:43,002
This is awesome, I'm so happy.

97
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:47,169
So I'd like to say good job, congratulations and woohoo!
