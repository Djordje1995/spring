1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,211
<v Instructor>Okay, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,357
jump into our development process.

3
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:05,633
The first thing we're gonna do here

4
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,728
is define a method to expose the bean.

5
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:11,895
Then we'll add this to our Java configuration class.

6
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:17,056
So moving into our actual Java config,

7
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:21,223
our SportConfig.Java, defining a method to expose a bean.

8
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:25,894
So I'll just simply put in some comments

9
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:27,705
here just to kind of keep myself on track.

10
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:28,979
So here I'll say define bean

11
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,359
for our sad fortune service.

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,287
And then I'll also define our bean

13
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:34,870
for our swim coach.

14
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:40,464
And inject dependencies for the swim coach.

15
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:42,964
Ooh, a lot of good stuff here.

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,559
Alright, so let me get some white space here

17
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,690
at the bottom to kind of stretch out.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,857
And up top I'll define a bean for our sad fortune service.

19
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:59,286
So I'll start with that at bean annotation.

20
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:02,473
And then I'll define a method here,

21
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:05,890
public FortuneService, sadFortuneService.

22
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:08,969
We can give any method name we want,

23
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,654
the method name is the actual bean ID

24
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,978
that's registered.

25
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:13,330
And then here I'll say return new

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,175
and then I'd create an instance

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,508
of that sad fortune service.

28
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,567
Let's just go through and fix the imports

29
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:23,837
here on the far left.

30
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:27,004
Import bean from the Spring framework.

31
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,024
And there we go, we've manually defined

32
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,957
our bean for our sadFortuneService.

33
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:34,738
And again, remember, the method name's

34
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:37,320
the actual bean ID that Spring will use

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,403
when they assign it to the container.

36
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:43,888
We have our first bean taken care of.

37
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:47,247
Now let's go ahead and take care of our swim coach.

38
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:50,548
So again, we say at-bean, and then we define a method,

39
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:53,965
public Coach and then I'll say swimCoach,

40
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,475
and then I simply say return new swim coach.

41
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,603
And I also inject the dependency here.

42
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,753
So here I'll say, I'll actually call that

43
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:08,420
sad fortune service bean method.

44
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,277
So, I'll put in a space here.

45
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,527
I'll say sadFortuneService.

46
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,871
Open paren, close paren.

47
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,182
Now it's really important here

48
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,131
to not that we're actually calling that bean method

49
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,391
up top on line 13.

50
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,401
So we're actually calling that method

51
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,698
and then it'll give us a reference to the actual bean.

52
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,710
And Spring will actually intercept that

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,635
and give us a reference to the object accordingly

54
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,481
based on the bean scope.

55
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,527
But anyway, there we go, so that's how

56
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,789
we inject the sadFortuneService

57
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,675
into our coach bean,

58
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,592
or our swim coach bean.

59
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,244
So that's our sad fortune service bean

60
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:50,714
that we've defined manually

61
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,438
and then also our swim coach

62
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,747
that we've defined manually.

63
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:54,729
So this looks pretty good.

64
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:57,872
So we've written a code in our configuration class

65
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:00,428
to actually define our beans manually.

66
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:01,261
Good job.

67
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,284
Now let's move back over.

68
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,376
We need a main program.

69
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:09,288
So I'm gonna do some more of my copy paste programming.

70
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,229
Please forgive me.

71
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,441
Don't judge me.

72
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,542
I'll go to this Java config demo app,

73
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,709
I'll right click and I'll choose copy.

74
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:21,752
And then I'll do a right click and I'll choose paste.

75
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:25,328
And the new name that I'll give,

76
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:28,402
I'll call it SwimJavaConfigDemo,

77
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,923
remove the two at the end.

78
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:32,222
So SwimJavaConfigDemoApp.

79
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:34,038
Ah, long name but we'll keep it,

80
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,788
we'll take it and we'll hit okay.

81
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,188
So let's go ahead and open up this SwimJavaConfigDemoApp.

82
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:46,038
So lines 10 through 13, or 10 through 12 actually,

83
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,661
takes care of our step three of reading

84
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,220
the Java config file.

85
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,568
We've seen that already.

86
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,604
And then line 15 is actually reading

87
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:56,225
or retrieving a bean from the container.

88
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,766
So we say get bean, swim coach.

89
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,852
So again, remember the actual bean method name

90
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:03,288
defined in our config file.

91
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,788
That's the actual bean id that we'll use here

92
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,940
for retrieving that bean reference.

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,773
So there we go.

94
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:10,606
So we have the bean.

95
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:11,439
We can call some methods on it,

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,619
getDailyWorkout, getDailyFortune, and so on.

97
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,417
So that's it.

98
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,873
One thing I want to do is go back to our configuration,

99
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,550
our SportConfig.Java.

100
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,315
I actually want to make one small enhancement

101
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:23,667
or one small change here.

102
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,048
So on line eight, I want to comment out the ComponentScan.

103
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,261
Here I don't want to do any component scanning

104
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,021
'cause I simply only want to make use

105
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,400
of the two beans that I've manually defined.

106
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,983
So just comment out line eight.

107
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,203
Alright, so now we're at a point

108
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:41,993
where we can actually go ahead and run the application.

109
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:43,685
So I'll simply do a right click,

110
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,018
and I'll choose Run As Java application.

111
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:49,645
Oh yeah!

112
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,083
So here we go, our swim coach says,

113
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,456
"Hey, swim 1000 meters as a warm up."

114
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,289
Really?

115
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,451
And then also Today is a sad day.

116
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:58,459
So the sad day portion, that's what we're getting

117
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,682
from our SadFortuneService.

118
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:03,022
So this works out as desired.

119
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,074
So instead of a sad day, it's actually a happy day

120
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:07,951
because we were successful here

121
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:12,118
in doing Java configuration of our Spring beans manually.

122
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:15,211
Woo hoo!

123
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,044
Good job.
