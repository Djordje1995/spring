1
00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:02,466
<v Instructor>Alright, I'm excited now.</v>

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,146
It's time to write some code.

3
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:06,282
So we want to make use of our SwimCoach

4
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,451
and our SadFortuneService so we have

5
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:10,298
to do some prep work first.

6
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,409
The first thing we have to do is

7
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,301
create our SadFortuneService, then we'll go through

8
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,590
and actually build out our SwimCoach.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,214
So that's what we'll start with.

10
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:22,000
So creating that SadFortuneService, I'll create a new class.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,024
I'll do a right click, I'll say New Class.

12
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,112
And the actual name I'll give for the class is

13
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,112
SadFortuneService 'cause I'm so sad.

14
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,220
And this SadFortuneService is going to implement

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,921
an interface so we move down to the Interfaces section

16
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,138
and click on the Add button.

17
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:44,055
And we'll select FortuneService from that list.

18
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,327
And then we'll hit the okay button.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay, great, so we have the interfaces listed here

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,690
in the Interfaces section.

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,104
Keep all the defaults and hit Finish.

22
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:01,993
Alrighty, so here's our SadFortuneService.

23
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm going to remove some of the auto-generated stuff,

24
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,367
and I'll return the sad fortune,

25
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,200
so Today is a sad day, oh my gosh.

26
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:18,633
And that's basically it, just a very simply

27
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:21,108
implementation here of this SadFortuneService.

28
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,666
I just want to mix it up a bit

29
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,666
and give us a different type of fortune service.

30
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,118
Alright, so now the next thing we need

31
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,357
to do for prep work is create the actual SwimCoach.

32
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,463
So I'll do a right click, I'll say New Class,

33
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,275
and the actual name of the class, I'll call it SwimCoach.

34
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,601
And then this SwimCoach also has to implement an interface

35
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,569
so down in the Interfaces section, I'll click

36
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,736
the Add button and I'll choose the Coach interface.

37
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,332
Alright, so here's our SwimCoach

38
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:54,888
with the Coach interface.

39
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,362
We can keep all the other defaults

40
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,029
and then hit Finish.

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,348
Alright, so I'll expand the window here.

42
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,316
And so here's our SwimCoach and we'll keep this

43
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,039
as a plain ole Java object, you know,

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,874
no special annotations here for component or anything.

45
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:11,098
We'll simply just write out a normal SwimCoach.

46
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,680
And remember a swim coach needs a fortune service.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,001
So I'll simply define a field here for fortuneService

48
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,384
and then I'll also define a constructor

49
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:22,681
so we can make use of constructor injection.

50
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,602
So I'll create SwimCoach FortuneService

51
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,784
and then I'll say theFortuneService

52
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:30,620
as a parameter being passed in.

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,297
And then like any normal constructor, right,

54
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,522
we simply make an assignment.

55
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,736
So here I'll say fortuneService the field equals

56
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:40,736
theFortuneService the parameter being passed in.

57
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,473
And that will basically take care of it.

58
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:46,209
So we have our field defined and we also have a constructor

59
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,515
that Spring can use to actually inject

60
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,306
the data or the dependency.

61
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:52,666
Alright, so let's move on down here

62
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,514
and let's fix up some of our other methods,

63
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:57,236
remove the auto-generated stuff.

64
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,414
And for daily workout, let's see what

65
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:01,269
our swim coach will provide for us

66
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:03,436
as far as a daily workout.

67
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,815
So our swim coach will say, "Swim 1,000 meters

68
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:09,129
"as a warm up."

69
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,178
Whoa, as a warm up?

70
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:15,647
Okay, that's a pretty intense workout, coach.

71
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,977
Alrighty, but anyways, so that's our daily workout there.

72
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,073
And then for the fortune, let me get

73
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,630
some white space here at the bottom.

74
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,395
We simply make use of our fortuneService

75
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,182
and we simply say fortuneService.getFortune,

76
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,268
very simple, very straightforward.

77
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,478
So these two methods here getDailyWorkout

78
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,225
and getDailyFortune, we have a very basic

79
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:36,555
implementation for them here so this kind of follows

80
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,023
with everything that we've seen before

81
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,606
in some of our previous videos.

82
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,097
Alright, so then just kind of just recapping

83
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:50,380
everything here so our SwimCoach needs a fortune service

84
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,286
and so we set it up where the fortuneService will be

85
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:56,853
passed in, the SwimCoach constructor and setup.

86
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,498
So we're in good shape here.

87
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,664
This is all our prep work taken care of.

88
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:02,345
In the next video we'll get down and dirty

89
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,771
and start doing the bean definitions.

90
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,521
So I'll see ya there.
