1
00:00:01,237 --> 00:00:02,517
<v Instructor>Alright, so let's move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:04,676
and let's get ready to write some code!

3
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:06,663
So here starting with our development process,

4
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,077
the first thing we need to do

5
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:10,217
is create our Properties File.

6
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:12,208
That's gonna hold our name value pairs

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,125
of the data that we want to inject.

8
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:19,135 line:15% 
So what I'll do is on my source directory,

9
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:21,666 line:15% 
I'll do a right click, and say new file

10
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,176
and make sure you select the source directory there,

11
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,009
new file.

12
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,143
The actual name of the file that I'll have

13
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:31,810
is sport.properties,

14
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,879
and again make sure that it's in the source directory,

15
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,162
cause that's our actual class path for our application,

16
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:44,440
and then go ahead and select the finish button.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,023
Alright, so we have an empty file right now.

18
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:49,732
So now what we need to do is add some name value pairs here

19
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:50,815
to this file.

20
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,842
So the first property is foo.email

21
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:08,007
and the actual email address is myeasycoach@luv2code.com.

22
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,039
My second property name is foo.team

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,206
and then I give the actual team name of Awesome Java Coders,

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,772
that's us, yeah!

25
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,765
Alright, so that's our properties file.

26
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:25,534
Once you're happy with that, go ahead and save it.

27
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,147
So that pretty much takes care of step one.

28
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,484 line:15% 
Now we need to get ready for step two,

29
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:31,718 line:15% 
and that's actually loading the Properties File

30
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,527 line:15% 
into our Spring config.

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,135 line:15% 
So we go back to our Java class,

32
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,320 line:15% 
our SportConfig.Java, right?

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,237 line:15% 
We're doing this Java based configuration here.

34
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:46,342
And let's move down to line seven.

35
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:47,276
Just right after line seven,

36
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,390
we're gonna add a new entry here.

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,136
So line eight, will actually make a reference

38
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:53,719
to that annotation.

39
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,792
We'll make use of that annotation Add Property Source

40
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,072
and then we simply give the location

41
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:06,497
of that Properties File, classpath:sport.properties.

42
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:09,330
I'll go ahead and fix the imports.

43
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:14,006
And there we go, so this looks pretty good.
