00:00:01,328 --> 00:00:02,161
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:04,034
we're going to learn how to inject values

3
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:05,951
from a properties file.

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,254
So we'll make use of our Swim Coach

5
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:11,971
and we'll also use as properties file.

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,197
This properties file is going to have

7
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:15,664
the email address, and a team.

8
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,888
And we want to read information from this properties file

9
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:22,735
and inject it into our Swim Coach to make use of.

10
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,051
Again, I love doing everything step-by-step,

11
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,767
so here's our development process.

12
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:29,497
The first thing is creating the properties file,

13
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,758
then we'll actually load the properties file

14
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:34,188
into our Spring configuration.

15
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:36,716
And then next, we'll actually reference the values

16
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:39,102
from the properties file.

17
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,688
So starting with step one, creating the properties file.

18
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:42,651
Very simple.

19
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,307
You simply open up a text editor,

20
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,903
create a file that has name-value pairs,

21
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:49,386
so the name of the property is foo.email,

22
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:52,360
the value is myeasycoach, and we repeat the

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,641
same process for foo.team.

24
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:55,474
And that's it.

25
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,904
Save the properties file as sport.properties.

26
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:00,544
Then in step two, we actually need

27
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:03,711
to load the properties file into our Spring config.

28
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:07,205
So again, you make use of that Java-based configuration,

29
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,009
our public class SportConfig, we make use of this

30
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,757
new annotation up top called @PropertySource,

31
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:15,555
and then you simply give a reference to where

32
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,587
your properties file is located.

33
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:19,523
So in this example, were going to say that

34
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:22,272
our file is located on our class path,

35
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:26,418
and the actual name of the file is sport.properties.

36
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,881
So here's step three, referencing the values from

37
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:29,961
the properties file.

38
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:31,175
So here's our Swim Coach,

39
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,873
and basically what we need to do now

40
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,659
is actually inject, or reference those values

41
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,526
from the properties.

42
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:40,101
So here, the Swim Coach is going to have two fields here,

43
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,716
for email address and team.

44
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,210
And what we'll do is we'll actually make use

45
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,777
of field level injection.

46
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,045
So to inject those values,

47
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:51,487
I simply make use of this annotation called @Value,

48
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,509
and then I give the actual name of the property.

49
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,156
Now I placed the name of the property

50
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:58,469
inside of a dollar sign curly brace,

51
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,541
and then here, foo.email.

52
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,798
It'll inject that value into our field

53
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,245
and our class called email.

54
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:06,774
We simply repeat the process again

55
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:09,114
here for the next property, foo.team,

56
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:12,536
so @Value("${foo.team}").

57
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:14,916
It injects it into the team field.

58
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,168
And then later on, the Swim Coach

59
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,393
can use those values to maybe display some information

60
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,274
so on and so forth.

61
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,819
So that's basically how you reference values

62
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,351
from properties files.

63
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,792
You simply make use of the @Value annotation.

64
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,148
What we'll do in the next video,

65
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,094
is that we'll move into Eclipse, and we'll actually

66
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,104
write all the code to make this happen.

67
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:34,021
So I'll see you in the next video.
