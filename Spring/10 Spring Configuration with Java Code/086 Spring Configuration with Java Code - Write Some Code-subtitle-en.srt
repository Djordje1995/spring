1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:02,612
<v ->Let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:05,209
and let's get our hands dirty writing some code.

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:06,857
So again, our development process,

4
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,761
we'll walk through this step-by-step.

5
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,106
We'll start off here with our first step

6
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:11,606
of creating a Java class

7
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:15,439
and then we'll annotate it as a configuration.

8
00:00:17,122 --> 00:00:19,378 line:15% 
So here I'll simply create a new class

9
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:23,711 line:15% 
and I'll give the @Configuration annotation.

10
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,310
I'll simply right-click on my package.

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,977
I'll say New, Class.

12
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:30,977
And for the name of the class,

13
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:32,190
I'll do just like the slides.

14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,570
I'll say SportConfig and that's it.

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,737
We can keep all the other defaults and hit Finish.

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,840
Okay, great, it gives me a very basic class.

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,532
I'm going go ahead and expand my window here for a second.

18
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:47,618 line:15% 
And the first thing I like to do

19
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:48,861 line:15% 
as far as my step one is that

20
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:51,511 line:15% 
I like to add the annotation here.

21
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,401 line:15% 
So I'll add the @Configuration annotation.

22
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,594 line:15% 
This basically will tell spring,

23
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:58,946 line:15% 
hey, this is a Java configuration

24
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:02,403
and follow the appropriate rules or directions here

25
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:04,653
in this configuration file.

26
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:08,955
Alright, now we have our very basic SportConfig.

27
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:09,788
But it's empty.

28
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:10,621
There's nothing in it.

29
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,238
There's no beans to find. Nothing.

30
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,311
So we need to somehow go by and fix that.

31
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,644
And we'll do that right now.

32
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,365 line:15% 
Step two is that we're going to

33
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,199 line:15% 
add component scanning support

34
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:25,266 line:15% 
by simply adding the @ComponentScan annotation.

35
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,850
And you simply give the actual package

36
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,407
that you want to use to have spring to start scanning.

37
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:35,841
And, again, this works exactly like XML component scanning.

38
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,791
They'll simply scan this package,

39
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,400
find all the classes that have the @Component annotation

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,391
and then register them in the spring container.

41
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:46,675
So, again, exactly the same as what you've learned so far.

42
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:48,042
Instead, here we're simply using

43
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,186
a Java class for setting this up.

44
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,856
But in the previous examples we used XML.

45
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:54,781
Again, exactly the same there.

46
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,824
Alright, so this looks pretty good.

47
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,934
We have our very basic Java configuration class set up.

48
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,194
We have the @Configuration annotation.

49
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:05,213
And we also tell it to do the component scanning

50
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,130
with the @ComponentScan annotation.

51
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,365
Now what we need to do is set up our main program.

52
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,347
What I'll do is I'll do some copy/paste programming

53
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:14,712
here for this.

54
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:17,866
I'll actually start with our AnnotationDemoApp.

55
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:22,552
So I'll simply just copy this AnnotationDemoApp.

56
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:25,635
With just a right-click, choose Copy.

57
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,368
And then I'll simply paste it

58
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:31,118
by doing a right-click and Paste.

59
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:38,347
And for the new name here I'll call it JavaConfigDemo.

60
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:40,556
I'll take off the 2 at the end and leave it at that.

61
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:43,580
So, JavaConfigDemoApp and once you're happy with all of that

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,663
then hit the Okay button.

63
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:54,910
We have this new file here JavaConfigDemoApp.

64
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,794
Open it up.

65
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,294
Expand the window.

66
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:01,129
And, again, pretty much everything like we've seen before.

67
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,347
We're only going to make one slight change here.

68
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:07,942 line:15% 
On lines 9 through 11, instead of reading the XML file,

69
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:09,256 line:15% 
we're going to instead make use of our

70
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,423 line:15% 
spring java configuration class that we just created.

71
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,267
I'll make use of that class here

72
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:21,767
called AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.

73
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:27,996
I'll simply copy that name because

74
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:30,752
that's one big name there.

75
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,617
Actually, I'll fix the imports first here.

76
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:35,961
I fixed the import, okay, so I have it.

77
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:38,527
Then I'll simply copy AnnotationConfigApplicationContext

78
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,427
and paste it right there.

79
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,922
So, no more XML.

80
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:42,922
No more XML!

81
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,055
We're going to make use of our

82
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,409
annotation configuration class.

83
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,871
So I'll say SportConfig.class.

84
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,694
That's the class that we just created.

85
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:53,527
And that's it.

86
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:57,740
That's how you read your spring config java class.

87
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,635
Let me even update my documentation here.

88
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:04,747
So read spring config java class.

89
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:05,622
Okay, that looks good.

90
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,066
So we're in good shape here.

91
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,186
Now the final step, step four.

92
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,849
Nothing new.

93
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,950 line:15% 
That step is basically retrieving the bean

94
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,132 line:15% 
from the container.

95
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:18,234 line:15% 
And it's the exact same process you've seen before.

96
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:21,017 line:15% 
We already have a application context created.

97
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:21,850 line:15% 
We simply say

98
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,402
context, get bean, tennis coach.

99
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:24,235
And that's it.

100
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:25,375
Everything else is the same.

101
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,978
So really lines 10 through 12,

102
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,604
those are the only changes here

103
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,874
that we made for this example.

104
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,250
So let's go ahead and run the application.

105
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Right-click, Run As, Java App.

106
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:39,843
Then we open it up and oh, yeah!

107
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,543
So this app is going to work exactly the same.

108
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,078
The only difference here is

109
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,539
that instead of reading the configuration

110
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,431
from an XML file, we're actually reading it

111
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:51,708
from our Java class.

112
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,609
Our Java class that's configured,

113
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,926
it's handling all of the configuration

114
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,811
of the spring container.

115
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,411
At this point there's no XML being used.

116
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,111
We can verify that by looking here in the spring logs

117
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,745
where it says AnnotationConfigAppContext

118
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,115
so that we know that it's actually reading our

119
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,872
Java configuration class for handling or managing

120
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,152
this spring configuration.

121
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:14,100
So this is great.

122
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,032
We made some good progress here.

123
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,423
We were successful.

124
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:20,590
And, again, I'd like to say great job.
