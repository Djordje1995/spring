00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,077 line:15% 
<v Instructor>Well one way to resolve is simply tell</v>

2
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:05,781 line:15% 
the silly controller, hey go change your mapping.

3
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:07,806 line:15% 
(chuckle) Go change your stuff.

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:09,485 line:15% 
But for some reason,

5
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:11,031 line:15% 
for political reason or I don't know,

6
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,351 line:15% 
they don't wanna change it or they don't see fit,

7
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,266 line:15% 
and then you say fine, go ahead and keep your mapping

8
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,322 line:15% 
the way you want it and on the Hello World controller,

9
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:21,239 line:15% 
we'll give our own path

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,480 line:15% 
and then we'll have relative sub-paths

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,723 line:15% 
or relative sub-directives

12
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:31,339 line:15% 
and that's how we'll resolve it here on our side.

13
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,272 line:15% 
So we'll make some changes here

14
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:37,550 line:15% 
to the Hello World controller to resolve this ambiguity.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,086
So just kinda moving back to the actual...

16
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:44,253
We're gonna close this window here and

17
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:48,755
moving back to my Hello World controller,

18
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:52,770 line:15% 
what I'll do is I'll actually put a parent mapping

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,937 line:15% 
up at the top.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,405 line:15% 
So let me expand my window here,

21
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,244 line:15% 
and so I'll set a parent mapping at the top, so I'll say

22
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:02,827
at request mapping,

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,343
and then I give the parent mapping of /hello.

24
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:10,608
So this is the high-level mapping

25
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,310
or the main directory,

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,593
and then you're gonna have sub-mappings off of it,

27
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:18,109
and so now, all these others show form and process form,

28
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:21,038
these are all relative to Hello.

29
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:25,401
So the full path for show form will be hello/showform.

30
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:28,900
The full path of process form will be hello/processform.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,599
And that will remove that ambiguity.

32
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,458
Now, the one thing I need to do is here is kinda

33
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,450
set up one of the links here that I have

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,553
for my initial show form, so in my main menu,

35
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:42,720 line:15% 
I need to modify that to make use of this /Hello.

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,502 line:15% 
So let's go ahead and do that now.

37
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:50,401
So in my main menu, instead of saying showform directly,

38
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,425
I'm gonna say hello/showform,

39
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,696
so it's gonna call the show form mapping

40
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:58,876
that's in my Hello World controller,

41
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,035
because I set the parent mapping

42
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,133
for that Hello World controller to be hello.

43
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,382
So that's how we can kinda resolve that issue there,

44
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:09,732
so now there's no longer a conflict between the two

45
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:13,089
because now show form is relative to Hello.

46
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:17,047
So I save everything, go right-click, choose Run As,

47
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:17,964
run server,

48
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,014
and we see our main menu, which is great,

49
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:23,326
so that's nice.

50
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,043
And we can also go check out our console,

51
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:27,567
kinda scroll through.

52
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,623
There's no errors,

53
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:33,334
and we can see now that we have hello/showform,

54
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:36,566
hello/processformVersionThree,

55
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,245
processform, process form version two,

56
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,749
so on and so forth.

57
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,149
So it's relative to Hello,

58
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:46,180
the Hello parent path so far, which is great,

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,452
and it maps all of the Hello World controller so far,

60
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,036
so we kinda resolved all the ambiguity,

61
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,965
everything is happy in the Spring World now,

62
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,273
and now we're ready to go, so this is good so far.

63
00:02:58,273 --> 00:02:59,910
So now we simply run back to our application

64
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,624
and now everything is gonna work

65
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:05,290
just as we had before, so we can enter a student name,

66
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,640
and hit submit,

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,497
and everything processes A-okay.

68
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,920
Then note the URL is a little different up top here,

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,697
so it has /hello

70
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:17,703
and then process form version three, blah blah blah.

71
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:20,719
So we've kinda clarified or

72
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,617
removed that ambiguity that we had a little bit earlier,

73
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:26,431
and that's by making use of parent request mapping.

74
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,746
So anyway, good stuff here.

75
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,921
You'll probably run into this in the real world, so

76
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:33,228
I wanted to show you a good example of how to resolve it,

77
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,482
and how to fix it.

78
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,872
Alright, congrats.

79
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:36,705
Good job.
