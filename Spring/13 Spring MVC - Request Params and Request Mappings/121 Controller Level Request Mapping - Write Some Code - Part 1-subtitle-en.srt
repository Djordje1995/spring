1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:02,280
<v Voiceover>All right.</v>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,016
So let's go ahead and move into Eclipse here,

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:06,097
and let's actually kind of walk through

4
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:10,264
this scenario where we have conflicts in request paths.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,533
So what I'll do is I'll actually create

6
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,196
a new controller,

7
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:18,207
and I'll try and break things on purpose.

8
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,050
We already have this helloworld controller

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,262
that already has a request mapping for showForm,

10
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,072
and I'll create a new controller

11
00:00:26,072 --> 00:00:29,082
that has the exact same request mapping.

12
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,916
And again, let's just try and break this thing,

13
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,799
and let's see what Spring gives us.

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,149
And then also, we'll learn how to kind of

15
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,032
resolve this or how to fix it.

16
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:38,483
All right, so let's go ahead and add

17
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,147
a new controller class here,

18
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:41,523
so I'll do a right click,

19
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,605
I'll say New Class.

20
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:47,627
And the actual name, I'll call it SillyController.

21
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,031
(chuckles)

22
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:52,187
SillyController, get outta here.

23
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,638
And I'll keep all the defaults and hit Finish.

24
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,166
All right, so here's our SillyController.

25
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,932
Up top, we'll give the @Controller annotation

26
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:02,739
like we always do for our Spring MVC

27
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,656
controllers XD imports.

28
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,250
And now I'll go down here,

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,333
and I'll set up a method.

30
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:16,902
I'll call it displayTheForm.

31
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:18,902
That just returns silly,

32
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:22,080
just kind of making this up.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,308
There is no silly view template yet,

34
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:25,552
but anyway, let's only just check this stuff out.

35
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,927
And again, I'm gonna copy the actual mapping

36
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:30,200
from the helloworld controller.

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,038
So helloworld controller has a mapping of /showForm.

38
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,967
I'm gonna copy this,

39
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:39,384
and then use that same mapping for silly.

40
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:44,680
So I'll just do a right click, choose Copy,

41
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:51,696
move over to sillycontroller,

42
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,779
and do a paste over here.

43
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:00,535
All right, great.

44
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,317
So different method names,

45
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:05,376
but the same request mapping, all right?

46
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,754
So the key here is that Spring handles everything

47
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:08,971
based on a request mapping.

48
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,490
So here, hellworld has show form,

49
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,828
and sillycontroller has show form.

50
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,484
All right, so let's go ahead and save everything,

51
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,537
and let's go ahead and run this application.

52
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:21,848
Right click, Run As, Run on the Server,

53
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:26,015
and I will take a look at the console window here.

54
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,847
Ooh, I saw some bad stuff there in the stack trace,

55
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,870
and ugh, see some ugly stuff here in the browser.

56
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,120
Wah! The dreaded 500 error.

57
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,417
And I'm pretty sure you're gonna run into this

58
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:44,031
during your lifetime as a Spring MVC developer, okay?

59
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,492
So the good thing here is,

60
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,613
let's kind of dig through this

61
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:47,823
and find out what's happening here.

62
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,842
So error creating a bean,

63
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,762
request mapping,

64
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:54,529
and it says here that there's already

65
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,529
a helloworld controller,

66
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,356
bean mothod, okay.

67
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,849
All right.

68
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,030
And it says ambiguous mapping, okay?

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,197
So could not map sillycontroller method,

70
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,479
because there's already a helloworld controller

71
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,085
bean method ... Ah!

72
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,259
Okay, so it's giving us some information here.

73
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:17,704
It's saying, hey, you can't use this dude,

74
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:19,695
because someone else is using it,

75
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:21,464
the helloworld controller is using it.

76
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:22,928
So you can see the information here

77
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:25,203
in this browser window,

78
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,450
but you can also take a look at it

79
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,616
in the console window,

80
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,737
so let's did into that one.

81
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:32,727
So this is our stack trace of all the stuff.

82
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,720
And a similar thing here, ambiguous mapping,

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,970
cannot map sillycontroller.

84
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:40,384
There's already a helloworld controller bean method.

85
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,290
All right, okay, gotcha, gotcha.

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,457
All right, so that's the idea,

87
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,040
so we know that there's a conflict,

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,819
and we know that it's ambiguous,

89
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,978
and we somehow need to resolve it.

90
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,145
So let's go ahead and take a look at how we can resolve it.
