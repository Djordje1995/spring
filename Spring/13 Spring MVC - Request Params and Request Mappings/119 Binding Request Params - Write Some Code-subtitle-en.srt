1
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:02,517
<v Instructor>All righty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:04,642
and move into Eclipse and what we're gonna do here

3
00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:09,200
is make use of that @RequestParam annotation binding

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,450
for our controller methods.

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,309
So, what I'll do is I'll actually move

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,285
into my Hello World controller and I'm gonna make use

7
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,880
of a little copy/paste example here.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,904
I'm basically gonna copy everything I had

9
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:25,947
from processFormVersionTwo and then I'll just make

10
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:27,304
some small changes to it.

11
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,215
So, let me go ahead and highlight everything here

12
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,798
for this processFormVersionTwo.

13
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,671
All right, so I have everything in highlight

14
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:36,582
and let's just go ahead and just do a copy on this.

15
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:40,665
So, I'll simply do a right click and choose copy.

16
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,207
And, then I'll move a little further down here

17
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,116
in this Hello World controller

18
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,700
and I'm gonna paste this information

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,846
and again make some small changes here.

20
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,429
So, I'll right do a click and choose paste.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,638
So, a couple things here.

22
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:05,490
First off, I'll actually change the actual RequestMapping

23
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,209
so instead of processFormVersionTwo,

24
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,145
we'll call it processFormVersionThree.

25
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:13,742
And, then I'll also change the actual method name here

26
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,188
to make the method name different.

27
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:18,177
So, I'll call it processFormVersionThree.

28
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,647
I don't know, I'm just making it up there, okay?

29
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,192
All right, so those are the basic mods I wanted to make here

30
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,025
for this one.

31
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:28,586
So, again, a new RequestMapping processFormVersionThree

32
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,945
with a new method name of processFormVersionThree.

33
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,677
So, what I'm gonna do here is change the actual parameters

34
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,774
coming into this actual method.

35
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,918
So, instead of passing in the HttpServletRequest,

36
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:40,751
I'm actually gonna make use

37
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:44,501
of that Request binding annotation parameter.

38
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,095
So, I'll use @RequestParam and then give studentName.

39
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:57,262
So, I'm basically saying I wanna read in the HTML form field

40
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,400
coming into request studentName

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,352
and I'm gonna assign it a binder to theName.

42
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:07,558
So, let me go ahead and fix some of the imports here

43
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:08,744
for RequestParam.

44
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,473
I'm just highlight over it for one second.

45
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,036
Do an import on RequestParam

46
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:16,203
from the Spring framework for binding.

47
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:18,008
I'll take it.

48
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,693
All right, so again, we're basically gonna make use

49
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:21,999
of this Spring annotation.

50
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,047
So, it's gonna read the http server request

51
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,380
and read that form parameter studentName

52
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:33,798
and bind it to this Param we have coming into this method

53
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:35,304
called String theName.

54
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:39,804
So, now lines 53 through 54, we no longer need this code.

55
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:43,500
Spring will automatically do this code for us.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,309
So, by effectively adding that @RequestParam

57
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:50,668
behind the scenes, Spring is doing everything on line 54.

58
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:52,396
So, I can go ahead, right click this code

59
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,523
and just cut it or delete it.

60
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,495
All right, so we don't need that.

61
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:57,645
So, that's good to go.

62
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,854
So, we already have this theName coming in already

63
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,104
as a parameter.

64
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:06,667
So, we're good to go, so there we go String theName.

65
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,265
Now, here we make use of it a little bit later on

66
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,369
and we simply take it and convert it to all caps.

67
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:12,603
That's all good.

68
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,975
And, I'm simply gonna change the method,

69
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,879
I'm sorry, I'm gonna actually change the message here.

70
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,106
So, instead of saying Yo, then I don't know,

71
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:24,357
make something else up, Hey My Friend.

72
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:27,524
And I don't know from v3 or something.

73
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:32,257
All right, so I simply wanted to create a new message here

74
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:35,446
just to make it unique and distinct from the previous one

75
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,638
that we worked on for version two.

76
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,977
All right so here's our v3 message.

77
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,371
And then everything else stays the same here.

78
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:45,117
We simply added to the model and we return helloworld.

79
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:46,035
So, that's basically it.

80
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,065
So, I have a new handler method here

81
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:52,498
in my Hello World controller called processFormVersionThree.

82
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,178
We make use of the @RequestParam

83
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:56,973
for annotation parameter binding.

84
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:58,784
And, I don't know, this looks pretty good.

85
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,453
So, I need to take this actual path here

86
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,896
and I need to update my HTML form.

87
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,937
So, processFormVersionThree, I'll simply right click,

88
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:10,339
I'll choose copy, and then I'll go back to the form,

89
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:13,282
helloworldform.jsp and I update this.

90
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:16,647
So, instead of versionTwo, then I'll simply right click

91
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:20,230
and choose and do a paste for versionThree.

92
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,441
All right, so I just wanna make sure that my form

93
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,626
is pointing to the right code that I wanna execute here

94
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:27,876
for this video.

95
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,642
All right, so this looks good.

96
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:34,043
So, let's go ahead and save our form.

97
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,876
And let's go ahead and run our application.

98
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,231
So, just right click, Spring-MVC-demo.

99
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:42,898
Choose Run As and then choose Run On Server.

100
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,917
And I'll go ahead and just choose the link here

101
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:51,167
to take a look at the form.

102
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,908
And, now this form's been updated to point to VersionThree

103
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:58,367
so I'll just enter some student name here.

104
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,887
Just enter the name of Mary, hit submit.

105
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:04,403
And, now the message Hey My Friend from v3

106
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,553
and then Mary in all caps.

107
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:06,386
So, this is great.

108
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,510
So, we know that it really is reading our new code

109
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,707
for VersionThree and it's making use

110
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,619
of that @RequestParam binding.

111
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,366
So, anyways, just wanted to show you an example

112
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,989
of using that @RequestParam and how it works out

113
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:21,313
for reading form data.

114
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:22,838
Nice little shortcut for you.

115
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:26,921
So, good job and I'll see you in the next video.
