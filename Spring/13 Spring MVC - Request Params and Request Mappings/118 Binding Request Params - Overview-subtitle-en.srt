<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,753
we're going to learn how to read HTML form data

3
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:07,670
using the @RequestParam annotation.

4
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:12,326
So we'll actually work through a code example

5
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:14,619
similar what we've already worked on,

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,413
where were going to read the form data,

7
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,201
covert the name to uppercase,

8
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,547
and add the uppercase version to the model.

9
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,915
And you saw some of the coding for this already

10
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:26,166
with the Let's Shout Dude,

11
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,767
where we would read the student's name,

12
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:31,541
by saying request.getParameter("studentName"),

13
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:35,839
assigning it and then doing some work with it later on.

14
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,280
Now what we're going to do is use a different technique

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,507
for reading in the form data.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:45,178
So Spring has a special annotation called @RequestParam.

17
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,784
This will allow you to read form data,

18
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:50,947
and automatically bind it to a parameter

19
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,141
coming into your method.

20
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:56,569
So here in this example, I make use of @RequestParam,

21
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,879
and I give studentName.

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,944
So behind the scenes, Spring will actually read that data

23
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:04,588
from the request parameters,

24
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,427
and then it will take that data and bind it

25
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:10,741
to this variable that I have here called theName.

26
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:13,184
All right, so Spring will read the request parameter,

27
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:15,975
and bind it to variable theName, and at that point

28
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,767
we have the variable and we can use it

29
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,501
in our application.

30
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,855
But the key here is that Spring

31
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:22,815
has that special annotation here called

32
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:27,158
@RequestParam for reading form data for you.

33
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,416
All right, this looks really good.

34
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,164
Let's go ahead and move into the next video,

35
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,577
and let's jump into Eclipse, and let's write some code,

36
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:34,049
and let's try this out.

37
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,049
So, I'll see you there.
