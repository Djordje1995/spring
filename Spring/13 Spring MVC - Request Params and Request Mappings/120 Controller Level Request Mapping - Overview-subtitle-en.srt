<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:06,468
we're going to learn how to add controller request mappings.

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,335
So you can actually define a request mapping

4
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,870
at the controller level, so it basically

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,899
serves as like the parent mapping for the controller.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,150
All of the request mappings on the methods

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,131
are actually relative to the controller's path.

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,647
And this is very similar to setting up

9
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:27,107
a folder directory structure where you have

10
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,515
a parent directory, and you have subdirectories

11
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:30,631
underneath it.

12
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:34,714
A similar thing here with using request mappings.

13
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,116
All right, so let's look at a coding example.

14
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:39,980
So here we have our funny controller.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,205
We're going to add a controller mapping for it.

16
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:45,026
@RequestMapping/controller,

17
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,849
so that's the parent mapping,

18
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:51,163
then all other mappings on methods within this controller

19
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:53,649
are actually relative to it.

20
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,816
So for show form, we'd have /funny/showForm,

21
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:02,886
so all of the method mappings are relative to

22
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:04,972
the actual controller mapping.

23
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,081
And this is just a very nice way

24
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:09,281
for you to group your request mappings together,

25
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:11,065
and also a great technique

26
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:15,168
for resolving any problems or conflicts that you may have

27
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,501
with other request mappings.

28
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,712
All right, so that's the basic layout here.

29
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:25,158
In the next video, I'll actually show you a problem.

30
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,247
I'll show you a conflict where we have

31
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,766
two request mappings that have the same name,

32
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:32,405
and then I'll show you how we can resolve it

33
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:35,956
by making use of controller request mappings.

34
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:39,706
Alrighty, so I'll see you on the next video.
