1
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:02,599
<v Instructor>Alright, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,431
and dive in to Eclipse and we're gonna run

3
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:06,858
some demos here on Bean Scopes.

4
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:08,850
We'll take a look at those singleton scope

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,726
and a prototype scope and we'll see

6
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,471
all of this code running in action

7
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,888
and I don't know, just get a good feel for it.

8
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:17,924
The first thing we wanna do is,

9
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:20,753
copy our application context file.

10
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:23,108
We're actually going to create a new version of it,

11
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:26,371 line:15% 
so we'll take this existing application context,

12
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,954 line:15% 
we'll just do a right click and choose copy

13
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,451
and then, we'll simply paste it,

14
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,368
so we just do a right click and we choose paste

15
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,667
and this new version, we'll give it a new name here.

16
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:47,500
I'll call it, beanScope-applicationContext.xml

17
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,643
and so, with these spring config files,

18
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:54,703
you can really give them any name that you want.

19
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:57,313
Your project can actually have multiple config files

20
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:58,986
and here you simply reference the one that you want,

21
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:02,071
so you can call it anything, fubar.xml if you wanted to,

22
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,382
as long as you reference it with that name.

23
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:07,912
Anyway, I have my beanScope-applicationContext.xml,

24
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,176
now let's go ahead and bean it up,

25
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:11,926
let's go ahead and open this file

26
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,318
and what I wanna do is, I just clean it up.

27
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:20,401
There's some lines in here that I want to delete.

28
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:24,711
I'll select lines 10 and 11, I'll highlight those

29
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,677
and I'll delete these lines because we're

30
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:30,844
not going to use any of the property placeholder stuff here.

31
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:33,987
I'm moving down a little bit further

32
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:36,509
and I'll also remove that bean for myCricketCoach,

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,896
so I'll just highlight the lines 24 through 34

34
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:42,923
and I'll actually delete those lines

35
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,963
and I'll just clean up some of this white space,

36
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:48,195
move up and let's do a little quick check point,

37
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,031
so in this config file that we just created,

38
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:52,969
beanScope-applicationContext.xml,

39
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,162
these are the only two entries that we should have

40
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:58,186
inside of here for beans, so we'll have our FortuneService

41
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:02,022
and we'll have our Coach, that points to our TrackCoach

42
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,409
and that's all we should have, at this point.

43
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,777
Now, by default, since we didn't specify

44
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,149
a scope for our track coach, well, what's the scope?

45
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,520
Well, it's singleton right?

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,508
Basic information we've learned so far,

47
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,165
so it'll simply be a single bean,

48
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:20,232
now, everyone will reference when we run our application.

49
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:22,356
Let's go ahead and create another main app,

50
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:26,292
I'll call this guy, BeanScopeDemoApp.java,

51
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:30,459
so I'll just do a right click, I'll say, new class

52
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:36,023
and the actual name of the class again, BeanScopeDemoApp

53
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:42,136
and I'll also go down and I'll check the box there

54
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,534
for the public static void main,

55
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:45,970
because I'll have a main method,

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,398
just a little separate demo app that I'll use for

57
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:51,286
testing out this scoping stuff.

58
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,373
Alright, okay with all that stuff, hit, finish.

59
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:58,621
Alright, so we have a very simple bean scope demo app.

60
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,764
I'll just move in here and I'll just remove the

61
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,718
auto-generated stuff and I'll write some quick comments

62
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,916
here, as well as what I need to do.

63
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,668
This is kinda, you're getting really used to this now,

64
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,683
the first thing we need to do is,

65
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:12,457
load the spring configuration file

66
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:16,346
and then, simply retrieve beans from the spring container.

67
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,681
Alright, that's kinda the game plan,

68
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,477
let's write the code right here

69
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:22,269
and you should probably know most of this now,

70
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,107
from memory because you've seen this a lot

71
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:27,069
so this is good practice, this is how you can really learn

72
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,777
the technology, just by repeating it

73
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,765
over and over again, just like a sport,

74
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,182
practice, practice, practice.

75
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,054
Let me go ahead and use that ClassPathXmlApplicationContext,

76
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,574
I'll just do a copy paste, I say, new

77
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,682
and I give the actual name, so this is gonna be

78
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:51,000
the actual name of my new configuration file

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,711
that we just created, so that's

80
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,530
the file that we created called,

81
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,280
beanScope-applicationContext.xml,

82
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,611
let me go ahead and fix up the imports right here.

83
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:04,671
I'll just hover over and say, import that given class,

84
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:07,671
looks good and there we go, so yeah,

85
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:12,074
that's our new config file that we're reading in here,

86
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,741
beanScope-applicationContext.xml

87
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:18,186
so again, you can have as many config files

88
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:19,738
up here as you like for your project,

89
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,558
simply load the appropriate one.

90
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:22,969
Also, if you have multiple, you simply give

91
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,681
a common denominated list, you can load in

92
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,642
multiple configs if you wanted to.

93
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,112
Alright, let's keep it simple for now.

94
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,751
Now, let's go ahead and get some white space

95
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,918
and let's go ahead and retrieve the bean from the container.

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,316
I'm actually gonna retrieve two beans,

97
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,843
so I'll start off with the first one here.

98
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:44,843
I'll say, Coach theCoach = context.getBean,

99
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:50,005
I give the name, which is, myCoach

100
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:53,588
and then I give the interface, Coach.class.

101
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:58,001
Looks good, and also you can just copy paste this line,

102
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,751
for the second reference, so I'll

103
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:04,688
just do a paste on that one, instead of the coach,

104
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,694
I'll call it alphaCoach and everything

105
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:10,834
else here stays the same, so basically,

106
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,094
this is the code here for retrieving

107
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,378
the bean from the spring container.

108
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:18,325
Right now, it's a singleton, so

109
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,323
we should get the same reference

110
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:22,141
and we'll actually write some code in a second

111
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,489
to show us the reference, but I'll kinda pause for now.

112
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,790
In the next video, we'll write more code

113
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,527
to print out the results of this reference.

114
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:33,110
I'll see you in the next video.
