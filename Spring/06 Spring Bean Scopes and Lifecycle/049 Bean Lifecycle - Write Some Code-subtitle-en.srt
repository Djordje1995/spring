1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,140
<v Narrator>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,880
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,040
Looking at our development process,

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,010
the first thing we want to do is define methods

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,560
for init and destroy.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,370
So I'll go ahead and do this here.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,160
I'll make use of my TrackCoach.java class.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,310
So let's go ahead and move into this class.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,710
And we are going to just open it up.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,410
And we'll simply scroll down a bit

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,360
to the bottom, and we'll define those new methods.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,630
So again, I always like to drop in

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,670
some quick comments here just so I keep myself on track.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,800
So I want to add an init method,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,500
and I want to add a destroy method.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,770
So again, this is custom code that will execute

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,090
during the bean's lifecycle,

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,100
when the bean's being created

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,020
or the bean's being destroyed, our little custom hook.

20
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:59,420
And now what I want to do, just inside of this method here,

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,150
just print out a little message here

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,410
just so I know I'm actually inside the method.

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,440
So I'll say TrackCoach: inside method

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,280
do my startup stuff.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,290
So just to make sure that spring's actually calling

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,810
my initialization method.

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,310
But that's basically it right there.

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,960
So this looks pretty good so far.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,300
Alright, so let's move on down

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,540
and let's do a similar thing in here for our destroy method.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,730
So again, this is a hook or a method that'll be called

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,270
when your bean's actually being destroyed

33
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,780
by the spring container.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,910
So I'll call this doMyStartupStuff,

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,320
and I'll copy/paste the method down there.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,490
And I'll just copy/paste that method name, and ew.

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,510
I notice this is the wrong method name.

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,480
I have a typo here, so let me change this.

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
So instead of doMyStartupStuff, doMyCleanupStuffYoYo.

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,000
Alright, doMyCleanupStuff.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,833
So I'll copy/paste.

42
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,666
I'll fix that issue.

43
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,850
So again, that's different method names.

44
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,010
So this is our destroy method,

45
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,560
so I'll call it doMyCleanupStuffYoYo.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,540
And I'm being funny here just to verify

47
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,460
that, hey, there's no special method naming convention.

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,760
You can give it any method name that you want.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Alright, so that looks good.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,000
So that's our init method, and that's our destroy method.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good job so far.

52
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,870
Now let's go ahead and make use of a configuration file.

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,300
And what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna

54
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,380
just kind of copy/paste a previous config file

55
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,160
and simply make some changes to it.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,430
So I'm gonna copy/paste the beanScope-applicationContext.xml

57
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,100
from the previous video.

58
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,560
Simply do just a right-click and choose Copy

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,060
and then a right-click and choose Paste.

60
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,890
And then for the new name that I'll give here,

61
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,930
I'll call it beanLifeCycle-applicationContext

62
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,630
and remove the two at the end, .xml.

63
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,940
So again, we can have multiple config files, right?

64
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,210
So I'm just giving a unique name here

65
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,610
for this demo project.

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,050
And if you didn't complete the previous video,

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,050
simply grab any one of your XML files and just rename it.

68
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,290
So anyway, let's take a look

69
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,319
at this beanLifeCycle-applicationContext.xml,

70
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,500
and let's kind of expand the window here.

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,150
And let's move down.

72
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,580
Now there's one thing that's a leftover

73
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,670
from the previous video as far as playing around

74
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,870
with bean scopes.

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,370
So on line 19, I'm gonna delete this entry,

76
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,680
scope="prototype".

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,270
I'm gonna remove that because I want to make use

78
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,430
of simply just the default scope, right?

79
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,630
And as a quiz question, the default scope is singleton.

80
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,649
Alright.

81
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:35,530
Now here, let's go ahead and add our init method.

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,920
So we need to give the actual method name

83
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,500
from our bean class.

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,890
So I need to kind of move back over

85
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,230
to my TrackCoach and find out which init method

86
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,063
I'll use here.

87
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:47,040
So I'll call it doMyStartupStuff.

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,870
I'll simply copy that name, and then

89
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,010
I'll simply paste it here.

90
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,100
I use the keyboard for that, copy/paste.

91
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,933
And there we go.

92
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:55,766
So that's my init method.

93
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:56,599
That's in place.

94
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,510
Now let's do a similar thing here

95
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,610
for the destroy method, so destroy-method equals.

96
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,380
And again, I need to get that actual method name.

97
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,690
So I'll kind of move back over to TrackCoach,

98
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,070
and I'll copy that name.

99
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,210
So it's doMyCleanupStuffYoYo.

100
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,500
And then move back to the config,

101
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,950
and then paste that in there.

102
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,070
So that's our destroy method that spring will call

103
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,780
when the bean is being destroyed.

104
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,560
Alright, this looks pretty good.

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,310
Now I need to have a main program to kind of run everything.

106
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,620
So again, I'm gonna kind of copy

107
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,820
one of my previous examples.

108
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,410
We've been doing a lot of stuff from scratch.

109
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,790
And here I'm just gonna copy this

110
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,690
and just make some quick updates to it.

111
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,525
So here, I'm gonna copy this BeanScopeDemoApp,

112
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:54,160
BeanScopeDemoApp.java, tongue twister.

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,870
I'll just copy that, and I will just paste it.

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,142
And I'll give it a new name, so I'll call this

115
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:08,142
BeanLifeCycleDemoApp, take off the two at the end.

116
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,640
And if everything's okay, then we can click the OK button.

117
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,970
Alright, so we should have this new file here,

118
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,950
BeanLifeCycleDemoApp.java.

119
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,360
So let's go ahead and double-click that one,

120
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,640
open it up, expand the window.

121
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,690
Cool, now the first thing I want to do here is on line 11

122
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,260
where we have the actual file name.

123
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,450
I want to change this file name

124
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,150
to use my LifeCycle example.

125
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,820
Right, so it has to say

126
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,350
beanLifeCycle-applicationContext.xml.

127
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,570
You want to make sure that it's calling

128
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,460
the right config file for your application.

129
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,630
Alright, and then we'll kind of scroll down a bit.

130
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,400
I'll delete a lot of that other stuff that was there.

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,670
So we should have just a very simple program right now.

132
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,150
So again, we did a little copy/paste

133
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,900
to kind of help us out, but just a real small program:

134
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,430
load the config, retrieve the bean,

135
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,580
and close the context.

136
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,470
So just a little checkpoint to make sure

137
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,620
we're on the same page here.

138
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,050
And now I'm just gonna use the bean

139
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,410
once I've retrieved it from the container.

140
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,860
I'll just print out getDailyWorkout

141
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,080
just to print something to the screen, nothing big there.

142
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:23,600
And that's pretty much it for this little demo here

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
for the LifeCycle.

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,960
So we simply load the config file.

145
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,460
We retrieve the bean from the container,

146
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,460
call methods on it, and finally we close the spring context.

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,073
Alright, so that's it.

148
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,470
It looks good.

149
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,440
BeanLifeCycleDemoApp, it's ready.

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,510
Let's save it, and let's run it.

151
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,930
Right-click, Run as Java Application.

152
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,640
And cool, here's our output.

153
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,090
So, a couple of things here.

154
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,080
Make sure that it's reading from the right config file,

155
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,210
beanLifeCycle-applicationContext.xml.

156
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,420
So that's the correct file that we just created.

157
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,170
We see that it's calling our method,

158
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,800
inside method doMyStartupStuff, which is good.

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,700
That's our init method.

160
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,010
We call our daily workout which is great.

161
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,390
And then we see when this container's closing,

162
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,030
at the end it'll actually call our destroy method.

163
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,460
So, inside method doMyCleanupStuffYoYo.

164
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,873
So this is great.

165
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:27,620
So spring's actually calling our init method as desired

166
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,220
and it's also calling our destroy method.

167
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,053
So this is great.

168
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,260
So we can add our own custom hooks here

169
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,590
into the spring bean lifecycle.
