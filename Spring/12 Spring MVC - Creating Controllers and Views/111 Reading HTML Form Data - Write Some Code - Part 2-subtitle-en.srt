1
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:04,453
<v Instructor>All right, so now we have</v>

2
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:06,329
our HTML form taken care of.

3
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,394
Let's go back and just take a look at our controller

4
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:10,132
one more time, so they basically go through

5
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:12,653
and say /showForm, and they're gonna return,

6
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:14,320
helloworld-form.JSP.

7
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:17,595
All right, let's go ahead and run it real quick.

8
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:18,695
I'm gettin' anxious.

9
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:20,934
So we'll do a right click on our project,

10
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,517
and we'll choose run on server.

11
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,502
All right, so our project is up and running.

12
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:27,378
There's our home page.

13
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:30,617
Now, let's enter showForm, and make sure you use

14
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,419
the exact same case because it's case sensitive,

15
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:33,716
and oh, good job.

16
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:34,593
This looks good.

17
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,279
So our form displayed, but we're only halfway there.

18
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,729
We're not fully there yet.

19
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,591
So we can display the form, but we haven't really done

20
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:45,965
any work for handling the submit or handling the process.

21
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:48,846
So if I were to actually hit submit here and boom.

22
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:49,775
It'll break, okay.

23
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:50,772
(laughs)

24
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,454
Because it's a 404 because they can't find

25
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,037
anything to handle processForm.

26
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:58,068
So that's what the form's trying to do.

27
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,757
It's trying to send data to this path processForm,

28
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:03,222
but we haven't done that yet.

29
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:05,249
Oh, okay, but don't worry.

30
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:06,631
It's on our to do list, right.

31
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,954
So in line 18, we have this all kind of, you know,

32
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:12,833
listed out as a item to do, or line 17, 16 right now.

33
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,650
Anyway, so we have an item there to add a method

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,462
to process the HTML form.

35
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,643
So let's go ahead and do that now.

36
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:21,555
All right, so let's go ahead

37
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:23,632
and write our method for processForm.

38
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:25,753
So here I call it public String processForm.

39
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,698
And again, remember, you can use any method name.

40
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:31,865
We simply map it with the appropriate mapping here.

41
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,470
And then I'll say return.

42
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,637
And we're actually gonna return helloworld as a string.

43
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:41,827
And again, they're actually going to pass it over

44
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,935
to helloworld.jsp in the background.

45
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:46,039
So let's go ahead and copy this request mapping

46
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,172
and drop it in here.

47
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,271
So for request mapping, it's gonna be a /processForm,

48
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,232
so that's where the HTML is going to send it over

49
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:56,310
to this request mapping that I have listed on line 17.

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,591
And this is again, annotating this map we have

51
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,313
on line 18, processForm.

52
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,857
All right, so that's the real key.

53
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:05,007
That's the real glue here for pulling it all together.

54
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:08,073
And that's basically it so far, so this method's in place.

55
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:10,249
It can handle that web request.

56
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,831
But now, we need to actually write the code here

57
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,914
for our view template for helloworld.

58
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:22,730
And we'll go ahead and do that now.

59
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,136
So in our view folder, we'll just do a right click,

60
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,136
and we'll say new, file.

61
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,027
And the actual name of the file

62
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,444
we'll call it helloworld.jsp.

63
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,201
And then we'll move down,

64
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,868
and we'll hit the finish button.

65
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:53,650
And I'll go ahead and just knock out my very basic HTML

66
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,150
header information real quick.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,133
Body.

68
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:02,469
And now, I'll just print out some text here.

69
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,302
Hello world of spring.

70
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,563
Give some line breaks here.

71
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,654
And now I'll simply read the form data,

72
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:14,798
so I'll say student name, colon, and I'll read it

73
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:16,657
by using a JSP expression language.

74
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:20,583
I use the dollar sign, param.studentName,

75
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,390
so studentName's the actual name of the HTML form field.

76
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,522
We can read form field data in JSP

77
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:31,330
by using dollar sign, param, dot, whatever that exact

78
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,467
form field name is.

79
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,545
And I have a little typo here.

80
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:36,777
Hell, world of spring.

81
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:37,725
That's bad.

82
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,861
I meant to say, hello world of spring.

83
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,742
'Cause everything is great with spring.

84
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,869
No such thing, okay.

85
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,225
All right, so that looks good.

86
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,815
So that's our actual HTML form.

87
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,632
So let's go ahead and save this file.

88
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,799
Let's get ready to run it.
