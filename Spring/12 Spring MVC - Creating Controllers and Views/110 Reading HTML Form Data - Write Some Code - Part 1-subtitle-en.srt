1
00:00:01,222 --> 00:00:02,055
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:04,156
and move into clips and let's start writing some code

3
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:05,906
to process form data.

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,141 line:15% 
So, the first thing we're going to need to do here

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:14,058 line:15% 
is to actually create our HelloWorldController.

6
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:19,995 line:15% 
So, we'll move into the package here, springdemo.mvc

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:24,215
and I'll do a right click, and I'll say New, Class.

8
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:28,382
And the name of this class will be HelloWorldController.

9
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,164
And once you're happy with the name,

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,331
we'll keep all the other defaults and then we'll hit Finish.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,073
All right, great, so here's our basic class.

12
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,931 line:15% 
I'll expand the window here.

13
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:43,284 line:15% 
And the first thing I'll always do here

14
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,607 line:15% 
is add the @Controller annotation,

15
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,265 line:15% 
because this is a springmvc controller.

16
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:51,598 line:15% 
I slide down here and I fix the imports.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,838
All right, that looks good.

18
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,151
And now what I'll do is I'll actually write

19
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,232
some comments to myself,

20
00:00:58,232 --> 00:00:59,644
just to kind of keep myself on track

21
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,679
as far as what I need to do.

22
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,929
(chuckles)

23
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,865
So, I know I'm going to need a controller method

24
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:10,948
to show the initial form.

25
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,229
And then once I have the form displayed,

26
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,604
I'm going to need a controller method

27
00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:20,021
to actually process the form.

28
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,007
All right, so those are the basic two things

29
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,974
that I'll need to do here in this HelloWorldController,

30
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:27,162
so I know I'll need to have at least two methods

31
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:28,995
for building this out.

32
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:33,098
All right, so let's go ahead

33
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,790
and take this one step at a time.

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,716
So, the first thing I need to do is set up my method here.

35
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,549
I'll call it showForm.

36
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:47,597
And it's going to basically return helloworld-form.

37
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:49,380
And we know in the background,

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,745
springmvc will add all the magic onto it.

39
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,412
I'll set up this @RequestMapping

40
00:01:56,374 --> 00:02:00,457
and I'll have it set up for /showForm.

41
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,557
And I'll also fix the imports here for RequestMapping

42
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,557
choose the first option.

43
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:10,747
All right, that looks good.

44
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:13,815
Okay, so stepping back, this looks really good so far.

45
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,511
So this is basically our controller method

46
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,473
to show the initial form.

47
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,424
So they're going to go to /showForm,

48
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:23,153 line:15% 
in the background we'll simply say, helloworld-form,

49
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,442 line:15% 
springmvc will add the WEB-INF/view,

50
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:28,025 line:15% 
and I'll append the .jsp.

51
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,280 line:15% 
So we're in good shape with

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,197 line:15% 
this layout so far for this method.

53
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:35,157
All right.

54
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:36,175
So now, we need to actually go through

55
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,760
and create that view page

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,983
or create the actual form.

57
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,422
So, in my WEB-INF "view" folder,

58
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,005
I'll say New, File.

59
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:50,014
And the actual name of the file is helloworld-form.jsp.

60
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:59,029
And I'll go ahead and hit the Finish button, here.

61
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:03,024
All right, so let me go ahead and expand the window here,

62
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,487 line:15% 
and let me go ahead and add

63
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:08,229 line:15% 
just my very basic HTML header information.

64
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,672 line:15% 
So &lt;html&gt;, and then I'll set up a &lt;head&gt; section,

65
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:14,422 line:15% 
and I'll also set up the &lt;title&gt;.

66
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:25,687
All right, so let's go ahead and define our form element.

67
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:29,770
And then we'll set the action="processForm".

68
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,098
And we'll set the method="GET".

69
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,344
So basically we're going to send something

70
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,520
over to the path /processForm,

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,650
and then the actual method type will be GET.

72
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,150
So it's going to pass it as a GET request,

73
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,065
as opposed to a POST request.

74
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:49,502
And we'll talk about GET and POST a little bit later.

75
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,197
So the input type="text",

76
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,030
and then name, we give

77
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,200
="studentName".

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,441
So that's the actual form field name.

79
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:00,328
And now I'll just set a placeholder here.

80
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,464
That will be the actual prompt text that you'll see

81
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,464
when the form is actually displayed.

82
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,456
So this is the prompt,

83
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,835
hey, "What's your name?" type stuff.

84
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,064
All right, so that looks good.

85
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,202
And now we'll just simply set up

86
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,690
an input type for the Submit button.

87
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,378
So type="submit".

88
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:21,411
And then I'll just take the default label

89
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,263
that they'll give me there.

90
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,944
And that's pretty much it for our form.

91
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:28,673
Just taking a look, stepping back.

92
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:31,975
Making sure I didn't miss anything.

93
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:35,022
So yeah, basic form field with a Submit button.

94
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:38,689
All right, so this looks really good so far.
