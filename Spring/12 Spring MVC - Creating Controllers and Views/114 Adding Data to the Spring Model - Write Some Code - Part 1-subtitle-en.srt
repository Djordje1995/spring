00:00:01,132 --> 00:00:01,965
<v Instructor>Alrighty,</v>

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,711
so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse here

3
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,207
and we are actually going to add some

4
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:08,745
methods to our HelloWorldController to handle that new

5
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:11,745
example code that we want to set up.

6
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:17,228
So let's go ahead and move into HelloWorldController

7
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:19,895
and let's expand the window here

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,120
and clear out some white space

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,975
and again I always like to write a little comment

10
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:30,142
to kind of keep myself on track as far as what I need to do.

11
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,060
So we're going to add a new controller method

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,477
to read form data

13
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,507
and also add data to the model.

14
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,674
So that's kinda our game plan as far as what we need to do.

15
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:48,828
So let's go ahead and define that method here letsShoutDude.

16
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:51,578
We're going to shout in all caps.

17
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,708
So we passing those two parameters the httpServerRequest

18
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,291
and also the Model.

19
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,804
We're going to return, "helloworld".

20
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:06,087
So that'll go back over to our helloworld.jsp.

21
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:08,836
So that's the basic stub here, for this method.

22
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,861
Let me slide over here and fix some of these imports.

23
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:14,596
So I'll fix the import httpServerRequest

24
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:17,279
and also fix the import for Model,

25
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:20,029
that's from the Spring Framework.

26
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,412
Alright, so let's just copy that @RequestMapping

27
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:32,745
from line 21

28
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:34,225
and let's move down

29
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,957
and let's paste it in right above our

30
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,707
letsShoutDude method.

31
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:46,776
Alright, clean up that extra white space there.

32
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:47,693
Okay, cool.

33
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,591
So we're going to change the RequestMapping path

34
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,674
to processFormVersionTwo.

35
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,021
So a unique path, where,

36
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:00,077
and we'll actually update our form

37
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,025
to point to this path also.

38
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,280
Alright so that's kinda the basic layout here

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,485
for this controller method,

40
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:08,349
but we still need to kind of fill in the blanks

41
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,432
and do some stuff inside.

42
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,141
So before I start writing code, as far as what I need to do,

43
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,212
I'll actually write some comments (laughs).

44
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:19,470
Again, I love to keep myself on track here.

45
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,134
So the first thing we need to do is

46
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:25,329
read the request parameter from the HTML form,

47
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:29,496
then I need to basically convert that data to all uppercase

48
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,562
because I want to shout.

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,817
Then we'll actually create our message.

50
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:39,409
So I'll say like, "Yo, dude.",

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,651
and finally I'm gonna add that message to the model.

52
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,122
So that's kind of the basic game plan of what I want to here

53
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:47,955
in this code

54
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:52,122
and it's very similar to what we had in the slides.

55
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,765
So again to read the form data

56
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:00,313
we simply say request.getParameter

57
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,480
and we give the actually form filled name of studentName

58
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:09,682
and then we actually go through

59
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,837
and convert this data to all caps.

60
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,920
I say theName.toUpperCase

61
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,467
and then next go through and I create the message.

62
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,952
So I'll say result equals

63
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,452
and I'll say "Yo!"

64
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:29,697
and I'll concatenate it with thename

65
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,049
and then the important thing here

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,613
is adding this to the model.

67
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:40,113
So I'll say model.addAttribute

68
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,553
and I give the actual name comma value.

69
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:48,636
The name of the attribute is "message"

70
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,327
and the value is result.

71
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,661
So that's the information from the previous line

72
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,689
that we just set up.

73
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:55,883
So that's kind of the main piece here,

74
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,966
adding data to the model.

75
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:02,569
So that's it for our method.

76
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,224
So we have this new RequestMapping processFormVersionTwo

77
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:09,650
we take in some parameters, we read the form data,

78
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,294
convert the names to uppercase, create a new message,

79
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,078
and add that to the model.

80
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:16,245
So this looks good so far.
