1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:03,042
<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna develop</v>

2
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:05,459
Spring controllers and views.

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,707
So we've seen the big picture of Spring, right?

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,783
The MVC, you have the front controller,

5
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:16,539
you have a controller object, and a view template.

6
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,461
What we're gonna do here is actually

7
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,706
set up a request mapping for a given path,

8
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,699
and then we'll have a home controller

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,474
that's gonna handle the request,

10
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:28,233
then it's gonna forward it over to a view template,

11
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,375
which we'll call main-menu.jsp.

12
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,951
And it's very simple, very straightforward,

13
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,034
but I just wanna make sure we get

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,784
all the mechanics down for building this out.

15
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,385
All right, so again, I love this

16
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:43,864
step-by-step process, right?

17
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:44,881
The first thing we're gonna do is

18
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,566
create the controller class,

19
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:50,220
then we'll define the controller method.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,319
Next we'll add request mappings

21
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,447
to the controller method,

22
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:58,008
and then we'll return the view name,

23
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,852
and then finally we'll develop the view page.

24
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,033
Woo, seems like a lot of stuff, right?

25
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,590
But don't worry, we'll go through all of this step-by-step,

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,340
and we'll do it all from scratch.

27
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:11,992
All right, so let's go ahead and start with step one,

28
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:13,995
creating the controller class.

29
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:15,805
Basically, you define a class,

30
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,784
and then you annotate it with @Controller.

31
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:20,551
Now, @Controller basically says that

32
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,760
this is a Spring MVC controller,

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,010
and also, one thing that's really cool is that

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,093
@Controller inherits from @Component,

35
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:33,332
so it's really just a specialized component

36
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:35,901
that supports web MVC.

37
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,517
The nice thing about this is that,

38
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:40,041
when Spring does its component scanning,

39
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,845
then it'll also pick up @Controllers

40
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,245
because they inherit or extend from @Component.

41
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:47,713
So this is the basic process here

42
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,296
of defining a controller class.

43
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,565
All right, so let's go ahead and take a look at

44
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:55,787
step two, defining a controller method.

45
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:59,445
So, here I have a method, public String showMyPage.

46
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,652
Now, this is a very simple method.

47
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,538
The actual method name is flexible.

48
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:06,059
You can give any method name that you want.

49
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,644
Here I called it showMyPage,

50
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:10,135
but I could've easily called it fubar.

51
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:11,912
The return type here is String.

52
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,563
I'm simply gonna return the actual view name

53
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:15,995
that I want them to show.

54
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:19,871
But again, this method here is actually very flexible.

55
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,920
So, in Spring, when you define your controller method,

56
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,245
you can actually pass in any number of parameters,

57
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,213
like request parameters, session objects,

58
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,803
and so on, or model objects.

59
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:32,472
And you can also return different variations here.

60
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:34,787
What I'll do is I'll keep it simple for right now,

61
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,875
but in the later videos,

62
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,716
I'll show you some other combinations,

63
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:42,108
some other forms of how we can define our controller method.

64
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:46,759
But this is a basic controller method for right now.

65
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,212
All right, so now that we have this method defined,

66
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,645
in step three we need to add the request mapping,

67
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:55,301
so we basically need to map some type of web request

68
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,159
to this given method, and we do this

69
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,144
with an annotation, @RequestMapping.

70
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,535
So you get the @RequestMapping

71
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,860
and you get the actual path that you wanna map.

72
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,794 line:15% 
So, in my example, I simply wanna map on the route,

73
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:09,086 line:15% 
so if they simply go to this website,

74
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,232 line:15% 
then they'll show this page here,

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,153 line:15% 
or they'll actually call this method here.

76
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,402 line:15% 
I'll show other examples of request mappings

77
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,596 line:15% 
in the following videos,

78
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,057 line:15% 
but this is just the basic one for right now.

79
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:20,611 line:15% 
And this request mapping will handle

80
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:24,778 line:15% 
all types of requests, get, post, and so on and so forth.

81
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,175
All right, so now, inside of the method,

82
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,399
with step four, we actually need to return the view name.

83
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:34,681
So, in this example I'm gonna return "main-menu."

84
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,341
That's the name of the view.

85
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,296
Now, remember here, there is some magic

86
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,112
that's gonna happen in the background.

87
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,789
Spring's actually gonna use information

88
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,896
from its configuration file,

89
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:46,288
and it'll actually find the view page.

90
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,332
So, based on the configs, it'll look

91
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:50,862
in a given prefix directory,

92
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,187
and it'll use the view name,

93
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:57,059
and then it'll pin the suffix ".jsp."

94
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,992
So, in this example here, it's gonna look for

95
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:03,159
/WEB-INf/view/main-menu.jsp.

96
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,105
So then step five is that

97
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:07,937
we actually have to create this page,

98
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:10,381
/WEB-INF/view/main-menu.jsp.

99
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:14,619
And again, it's any regular html page or jsp page.

100
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,573
You simply put in your html tags,

101
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,334
your markup, and so on.

102
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,750
So that's kinda the basic step here

103
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,146
for building a Spring MVC, I guess, page flow.

104
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:27,450
And here's just a quick recap of the steps.

105
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,544
Creating a controller, defining a controller method,

106
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,626
adding request mappings, the view,

107
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,269
and then the view page.

108
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,287
So what we'll do in the next video

109
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,063
is that we'll actually move into Eclipse,

110
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,898
and we'll actually build this out from scratch,

111
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,201
and then we'll run all the code,

112
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,716
and we'll get it up and running

113
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,218
on our local computer.

114
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,051
So I'll see you in the next video.
