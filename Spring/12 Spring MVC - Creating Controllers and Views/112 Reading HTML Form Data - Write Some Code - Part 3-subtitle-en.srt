1
00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:02,754
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:05,194 line:15% 
and run our application, I think we're ready

3
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,111 line:15% 
to test this thing out!

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,905
So we'll right-click on our project

5
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:15,009
and we'll choose Run As and run on the server!

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,491
Alright, so here's our page.

7
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,630
Now let's go ahead and enter /showForm

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,218
in the URL up top and hit enter.

9
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,457
Okay, great, there's our page.

10
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,017
So let's go ahead and enter a student name.

11
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,885
So I'll enter the student name of John

12
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:31,597
and I'll hit the submit button

13
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,214
and whoo-hoo, there we go.

14
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:35,988
Hello World of Spring, and student name

15
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:39,991
John, and John's the actual form data that we entered

16
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,429
so we're able to read

17
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:45,262
form data with Spring MVC, ya-hoo!

18
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:52,621
Alright, I'm having too much fun over here.

19
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,437
But one thing I wanna do is actually kinda

20
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:58,037
clean this up a bit, so that I don't have to enter

21
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,889 line:15% 
the show form every time.

22
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,271 line:15% 
I liked to be able to just have a link

23
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,508 line:15% 
that they will simply click and go to this form

24
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:08,796 line:15% 
just to kinda clean it up, make it a bit more professional.

25
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,664
So what I'm gonna do is actually move over

26
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:13,189 line:15% 
to this main-menu.jsp.

27
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,899 line:15% 
So this is the first page that's shown

28
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,232 line:15% 
whenever we run our project.

29
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,082 line:15% 
And I'm gonna set up an html link.

30
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:24,813
So here I'll set up

31
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,902
a little label here saying hello world form,

32
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:30,520
and then I will put an actual link for it here,

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,853
so a href equals

34
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:36,285
and then this will simply go to show form.

35
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:40,695
And then we'll put the end anchor tag at the end

36
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,300 line:15% 
and that's it, so now we'll have this Hello World form

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,703 line:15% 
show up as a hyperlink, and when they click it,

38
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:48,643 line:15% 
it'll go to show form.

39
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,660 line:15% 
It's the actual request mapping in our

40
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,721 line:15% 
Spring MVC code.

41
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,256
So here, let me just remove that show form at the beginning

42
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,423
of the URL, and hit enter.

43
00:01:58,529 --> 00:01:59,888
And great, so that's our home page

44
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,582
and note the new link here, whoo-hoo!

45
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:02,748
Looking good, looking good.

46
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,094
And then let's click this link and

47
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:08,561
magic (chuckle) shows the form.

48
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,833
Nothing really fancy, this is very basic html 101.

49
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,266
But anyway, we've kinda cleaned up our example a bit

50
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:16,846
so that we don't have to manually enter information

51
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,184
in the URL.

52
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:19,867
Enter the student name Billy, hit submit,

53
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,568
and everything works out as desired.

54
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:24,544
So anyway, just wanna kinda go full circle

55
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,580
building out that example, reading form data,

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,802
and then finally here at the end,

57
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:32,535
we just added a hyperlink to actually

58
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:34,184
automatically show the form

59
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,030
and end process on it, so

60
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,497
good example, I'm happy.

61
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:38,829
I hope you're happy.

62
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,264
We made some very good progress here.

63
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:44,097
So I'll see you in the next video.
