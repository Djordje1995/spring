1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:02,264
<v Instructor>Alright. So let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:03,972
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:06,073
What we're gonna do is walk through our development process

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,684
of creating a controller class,

5
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:09,777
the method, adding the mapping,

6
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,315
returning view name, and developing the view page.

7
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:14,720
And again, we'll go through all of this step by step

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,387
and we'll do it all from scratch right here.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,997 line:15% 
So there's some prep work that we have to do first

10
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:25,231 line:15% 
and that is actually creating a new package.

11
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,732 line:15% 
So I'll move into my Java Resources directory,

12
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:31,003 line:15% 
into the source package, I'll do a right click

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,086
and I'll say new package.

14
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,908
And the actual name for the package

15
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:42,075
that I'm gonna use here is com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc

16
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,077
'cause we're doing some Spring mvc baby.

17
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,374
Alright, that looks good.

18
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:52,733
Go ahead and hit the finish button.

19
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:53,994
Alright, so we have our new package,

20
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:55,500 line:15% 
so now we can start with step one,

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,282 line:15% 
creating the controller class.

22
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,911 line:15% 
So I'll simply right click on our new package,

23
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:02,911
and I'll say new and I'll say class.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,134
And the actual class name that we're gonna give here is

25
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,384
HomeController.

26
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,398
And I'll keep all the other defaults

27
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:18,065
and I'll hit finish.

28
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,634
Alright, great. So here's a very basic class.

29
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,356
It's empty, nothing's there.

30
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:30,939
Let me expand the window here for a second.

31
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,467
And the first thing we want to do here

32
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,213
is add the @Controller annotation.

33
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,948
So this basically tells Spring that,

34
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:41,350
hey this is an mvc controller and to make use of it.

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,576
So I'll simply fix the imports here

36
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,601
and I get the Spring stereotype controller, great.

37
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,384
So again remember that @Controller

38
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,599
extends off of @Component,

39
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,648 line:15% 
so they get picked up during component scanning.

40
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,288 line:15% 
Alright, so the next thing here is step two,

41
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:58,705 line:15% 
defining a controller method.

42
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,299 line:15% 
So just like in the slides,

43
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,858 line:15% 
I'll have a public String showPage.

44
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,990 line:15% 
For right now I'll just say return null

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,593 line:15% 
and remember it can be any method name.

46
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:11,089
Here I just called it a showPage,

47
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,287
but we could easily call it something totally different,

48
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,454
if you'd like.

49
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:18,702 line:15% 
And what I'll do now is in step three,

50
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,191 line:15% 
is I'll add the request mapping to the controller method.

51
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,574 line:15% 
So I'm basically gonna map a URL request

52
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,408 line:15% 
to this actual method.

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,977 line:15% 
So that's why the method name can be anything,

54
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,512
'cause we're gonna simply set up this

55
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:33,350
annotation mapping to attach this path to the given method.

56
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,392
And again, I go through and just fix my imports

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,929
here on @RequestMapping

58
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:38,913
and choose the first one there,

59
00:02:38,913 --> 00:02:43,085
so I should get the web bind request mapping.

60
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:43,918
Alright, so this is cool.

61
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:46,078
So this method here, showPage, it'll handle

62
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:50,242
all types of http requests for getting posts for

63
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:52,958
this slash and all the other http methods.

64
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,184
Alright, so this looks good so far.

65
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:55,893 line:15% 
Now let's go ahead in step four

66
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,839 line:15% 
and let's actually return the view names.

67
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:01,511 line:15% 
This is gonna be the name of the page that we wanna return.

68
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,114 line:15% 
Again remember, it's not the complete name of the page

69
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:07,632 line:15% 
because we make use of information from the config file

70
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:10,350 line:15% 
while they'll actually add a prefix

71
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,675 line:15% 
and they'll actually add the suffix.

72
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:16,302 line:15% 
So it'll be WEB-INF/view/main-menu.jsp

73
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,897 line:15% 
So Spring will do this automatically for you

74
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:22,980 line:15% 
in the background, some of Spring's little magic.

75
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,273
Alright, so this looks good.

76
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,635
So let's go ahead and create that view page.

77
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:29,567
So I'll move back over into my project,

78
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,378
under WebContent, WEB-INF

79
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,926
and then view folder.

80
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:35,508
I'll simply just do a right click

81
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:37,341
and I'll say new file.

82
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,947
And the name for the file, we'll call it main-menu.jsp.

83
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,594
And once you're happy with that,

84
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:59,927
go ahead and click on the finish button.

85
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,549
Alright, great. So at this point,

86
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,973
this is just a regular jsp file.

87
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,855
We can write any HTML markup here that we'd like.

88
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:12,038
So I'll just go ahead and start off with the DOCTYPE,

89
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,205
I'll say html,

90
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:17,718
do the basic header stuff, the body stuff,

91
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,465
and here I'll just put a title here,

92
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,228
Spring MVC Demo - Home Page.

93
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,678
And this'll kinda be like our starting point

94
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,543
or our main menu for some of the following examples

95
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,344
that we'll build here in this course.

96
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,365
Alright, so this looks good so far.

97
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:36,666
You can save it

98
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,582
and um, I don't know, it looks good.

99
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,749
I think we're in good shape right now.
