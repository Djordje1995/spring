00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:02,210
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,377
we're going to learn how to read form data with Spring MVC.

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,406
So at a high level, we're going to have a form,

4
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:12,302
we're going to prompt the user for their name,

5
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:13,658
they'll hit Submit Query,

6
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,062
it'll go through our Spring MVC application,

7
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:18,251
and then will show a confirmation page.

8
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,286
Hello World of Spring!

9
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,028
Student name, and we simply plug in the student name

10
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,528
that they entered.

11
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,752
So here's the application flow.

12
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:29,099
So in the browser, they'll go to our website

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,878
and they'll enter /showForm.

14
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,920
This will go to our HelloWorld Controller,

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,279
and the main purpose of this is

16
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,612
to simply show the JSP form.

17
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,130
Then, once we have a form displayed,

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,617
once they enter their information and hit Submit,

19
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:46,384
then they're going to pass it over to this

20
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:49,554
/processForm request mapping.

21
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:52,234
So again, it's going to go into our HelloWorld Controller,

22
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,556
and for that mapping, we'll simply pass back

23
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:58,204
a confirmation page, so we'll say Hello World of Spring!

24
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:01,092
Student name, and we simply plug in the student name.

25
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,421
So the key here is that we're going to use one

26
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,496
HelloWorld Controller that's going to have

27
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,246
two request mappings.

28
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:11,766
Now let's go ahead and look at

29
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,814
some of the source code here for the controller.

30
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:15,887
So again, with the Spring controller,

31
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:19,152
we always annotate with @Controller, up top.

32
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:22,689
Then I'll set up a method, to show the initial form.

33
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:25,730
So I'll define a request mapping /showForm,

34
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,284
I give a method name, pubic String showForm,

35
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:31,552
and then return "helloworld-form".

36
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:32,675
And then remember in the background,

37
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,083
Spring will add on that

38
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,516
WEB-INF/view/helloworld-form.jsp,

39
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:41,599
based on information from our configuration file.

40
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:45,821
Now we'll also need to add a second method here

41
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,647
to process the form.

42
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:50,624
So we'll have request mapping for /processForm,

43
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:53,107
and we have a method public String proccessForm,

44
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:55,120
and we simply return "helloworld".

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,795
That'll be the actual confirmation page

46
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,805
that will say Hello World of Spring,

47
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:01,484
and we simply display the student name.

48
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:04,236
Now again, remember the method names can be anything.

49
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:08,061
We simply map the paths to the actual method.

50
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,202
But again, you can use any method name you want,

51
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:14,369
show form, process form, do the work, FUBAR, whatever.

52
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,884
Alright so let's kind of step back

53
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:21,026
and look at the development process.

54
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,069
And again, everything's step-by-step.

55
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,133
So, first thing is creating a controller class,

56
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,922
and for showing the HTML form,

57
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,688
we'll have a controller method

58
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:30,987
to show the form, we saw that

59
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,743
in the previous slide, and we'll also need to

60
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:37,020
create the View Page for the HTML form.

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,611
And then for processing the form,

62
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:41,454
again we need to create the controller method

63
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,792
for processing the form, and also developing the View Page

64
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,800
to show the actual results.

65
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,389
Okay, so that's our development process.

66
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,441
In the next video, we're going to move into Eclipse,

67
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,904
and we're going to start writing some code.

68
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,821
So I'll see you there.
