1
00:00:01,178 --> 00:00:02,494
<v Instructor>Alright, so our controller's</v>

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:03,852
pretty much taken care of.

3
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:07,139 line:15% 
Now let's go ahead and update our view page,

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,834 line:15% 
so we can access information from the model.

5
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,506
So I'll move back over to my web (mumbles) view,

6
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:17,720
and I'll look at the file here, helloworld.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,555
So, that's helloworld.jsp.

8
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,805
And, I will add

9
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,101
some line breaks here.

10
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:30,812
Then I wanna read data from the model.

11
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:34,403
So, we can expand the window here for a second.

12
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:37,870
Give myself some white space here at the bottom.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,515
And, I'll say the message.

14
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:42,528
And, now to actually access the message,

15
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:44,451
or read that model data,

16
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,835
I use dollar sign, curly brace, message.

17
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,050
So again,

18
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,623
I wanna use dollar sign, curly brace, in this case message,

19
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,677
it's actually gonna access

20
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,927 line:15% 
a attribute from the model.

21
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:57,267 line:15% 
So, whatever we place in there,

22
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,251 line:15% 
under the name of message,

23
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,249 line:15% 
or the key of message,

24
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,652 line:15% 
it's gonna actually retrieve that information

25
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:05,324 line:15% 
and display it right here on the page.

26
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:06,445
And, now one other thing

27
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,207 line:15% 
we need to do is modify our form,

28
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,040 line:15% 
or update our form

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040 line:15% 
to now point to this new version of our process.

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,832
Because in our controller,

31
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:17,706
if we flip back over here, for a second,

32
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,048
that new code we just added,

33
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:22,562
this is for processFormVersionTwo.

34
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:24,013
Okay, that's a request mapping.

35
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,665
Also, if you copy that request mapping,

36
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,474
and I'll move back over to my form

37
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:31,396
and I'll paste that information in.

38
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,229
I like to do a copy paste

39
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,530
to make sure I don't have

40
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,313
any typo problems or errors,

41
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:37,234
'cause it's very case sensitive.

42
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:38,067
Alright, so there we go.

43
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,114
So, that's our form that's updated.

44
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,947
processFormVersionTwo.

45
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,857
Alright, so I'll save everything.

46
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,025
Let's go ahead and run this real quick.

47
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,655
So right click, choose run as,

48
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:52,155
and run on server.

49
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:54,160
Alrighty, so I can go ahead

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,503
and make use of the hypertext link

51
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,011
that we set up in the previous video,

52
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,247
which is cool.

53
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:02,747
And, I can go ahead and enter my student name.

54
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,830
My student name of Larry, hit submit.

55
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:07,731
And, there we go.

56
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:08,650
Hello World of Spring,

57
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,483
student, Larry.

58
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,494
And, now the message, this is our new stuff.

59
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:12,744
Yo Larry, okay.

60
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:15,199
So, we're shouting at Larry.

61
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,736
We took his name and converted it to all caps,

62
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,264
and we put yo on the front,

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,097
but actually I notice

64
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,439
I have little typo here

65
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,626
in my message, itself.

66
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,226
Yo, Larry.

67
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:25,549
There's no white space

68
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,026
between the words.

69
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,729
So, I'll show you this lil feature here.

70
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,799
So, if I need to make a modification

71
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,999
to my spring code,

72
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,767
I can make the change...

73
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,259
So, I'll enter a space here.

74
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,259
So, yo, space, the name,

75
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,926
then I can save this file,

76
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,349
and if you watch the console,

77
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,970
spring has a little...

78
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,118
Actually this is Tomcat.

79
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,550
Tomcat will basically check your code

80
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,263
to see if there were any modifications.

81
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:55,055
And, it'll run like every five or ten seconds.

82
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,906
But, note here, it just fired up,

83
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:57,985
so it noticed some changes

84
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:59,187
on the file system.

85
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,691
It's gonna reload your new version

86
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:02,143
of your controller,

87
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:03,033
and then you're ready to go.

88
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,242
So, the reload has been completed.

89
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,464
And, now there's no need

90
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:07,460
for us to stop the server

91
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,717
and start it again.

92
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,954
Tomcat automatically reloaded our new code

93
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,738
by simply saving

94
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:15,302
our controller code.

95
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:18,084
So, now if I go back to my browser,

96
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:20,906
I click on the back button

97
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:24,554
and I can keep the same name, I guess,

98
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,289
hit submit,

99
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,769
then it says yo, space, Larry. (chuckles)

100
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:31,732
So, notice here we made a modification

101
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:34,959
to our controller source code.

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,466
We saved it.

103
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,270
Tomcat is smart enough to notice

104
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,811
that we made a change to that file.

105
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,493
Tomcat automatically reloaded our application,

106
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:47,012
and we had our latest code ready to go.

107
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,385
So, this is cool.

108
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:49,656
So anyways,

109
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:50,489
we did some good stuff here.

110
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,528
We added data to the spring model.

111
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:54,994
So, I wanna say congrats.

112
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,641
Give yourself a pat on the back.

113
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,474
And, good job, so far.

114
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:03,286
You are rocking and rolling, dude.

115
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:06,189
Yo. (laughing)

116
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,514
Alright, I'm having too much fun again.

117
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,097
I'll see you in the next video.
