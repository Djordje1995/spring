1
00:00:01,143 --> 00:00:02,467
<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:05,634
about adding data to the spring model.

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,934
So the main focus here is on the model.

4
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,311
So far, we've covered the controller code.

5
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:13,814
We've covered view templates.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,322
But we didn't really talk about the model,

7
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,165
and so that's where we're gonna kind of zoom in here,

8
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,438
and see how we can use it, how we can add data to it,

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,453
and also how we can read data from the model.

10
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:28,370
It's all about the model right now.

11
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,688
So the spring model is really just a container

12
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:34,967
for your application data.

13
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,181
So in your controller code, you can put

14
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:39,219
anything in the model.

15
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,118
You can put in strings, objects, information

16
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:45,948
that you get from the database, et cetera.

17
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,278
And you can load it up.

18
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:49,625
And then your actual view page, or your JSP,

19
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,958
can actually access data from the model.

20
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,733
So what I'll do here is I'll actually walk

21
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,146
through a code example.

22
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:02,729
So I'm gonna create a new method to process form data.

23
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,941
I'm gonna read the form data.

24
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:09,367
And then I want to convert the form data to all upper case.

25
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:13,784
And then I'll add this upper case version of the data

26
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:17,951
to the model, and then we'll display it in the page.

27
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:24,347
When we make use of our spring controller,

28
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:27,011
we can actually pass the model to our controller,

29
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,373
and we can also read form data in our controller.

30
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,690
So what I'm gonna do here is create this new method

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,767
called letsShoutDude 'cause I'm gonna shout

32
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,037
and use everything in all caps.

33
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:40,595
That's just my little joke here.

34
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,665
And we're gonna set up a request mapping up top,

35
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:47,832
so the name of this request will be processFormVersionTwo.

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,753
All right so our method letsShoutDude

37
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:53,546
we're gonna pass in two parameters.

38
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,406
So in spring and receive, when you create your controller

39
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:59,411
methods, they're actually very flexible on the parameters

40
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,785
you can pass in, so if you need to read form data

41
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:05,142
in your controller code, then you pass

42
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:07,434
in the HttpServletRequest.

43
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,778
And it's working like the normal servlet request

44
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,912
that you've learned already.

45
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,502
And also, you can pass in the model.

46
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:15,053
So again, the model is just a container

47
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,061
that can hold your form data.

48
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,414
When the model comes in initially, it's empty,

49
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:21,664
and you can add data to it.

50
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:26,064
So let's kind of walk through this code here step by step.

51
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,494
So the first thing we want to do is read the request

52
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:30,911
parameter from the HTML form.

53
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,090
The form has a field name called studentName.

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,257
I simply say request.getParameter, studentName.

55
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:41,012
That allows me to read that form data,

56
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:45,645
and I simply assign it to a variable here called theName.

57
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,873
Now, in my little example, I want to convert the name

58
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:52,936
to all upper case, so I simply say theName.toUpperCase,

59
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:55,050
and assign it to itself.

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,934
So now I have an all caps version of the name,

61
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,959
kind of the way of shouting.

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,214
In the online world we always say

63
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,349
if you type in all caps, it's shouting.

64
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,508
So that's why we have this whole little shouting thing

65
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,541
going on here. (laughs)

66
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,977
Then, we're gonna create a message.

67
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:12,003
So our message is gonna be simply, yo,

68
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,778
and then whatever the person's name is.

69
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,540
Like, yo, Pauly.

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,855
Yo, Andrian.

71
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:17,688
Okay.

72
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:21,521
And that'll give us the message or the result.

73
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,282
So now that I have the result, I want to add

74
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,449
this message to the model.

75
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,906
So to add something to the model, I say model.addAttribute,

76
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:36,440
and the attribute I give the actual name

77
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,771
of the attribute, comma, the value.

78
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,938
So the name here is message, and the actual value is result.

79
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,520
So result is the object that we just created

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,863
on the previous line.

81
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,283
Now, the actual name of the attribute message,

82
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:55,028
you can give any name you want for the attribute.

83
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,878
You can call it fubar, funny, silly.

84
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,691
It's totally up to you as long as you're consistent

85
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,913
in other parts of your application.

86
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:06,258
And that's it for actually adding data to the model.

87
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,548
And then finally, I say return helloworld.

88
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,472
It'll go off to that helloworld.jsp page.

89
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:13,760
So that's the basic coding there for passing the model

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,927
to your controller and also adding data to the model.

91
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:26,335
All right, now in my actual view page, or my JSP,

92
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:29,866
I can access data from the model.

93
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,908
In order to access data from the model,

94
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:35,646
I simply make use of the dollar sign curly brace,

95
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:39,592
and I give the actual model attribute name.

96
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,296
So in the previous example, we set something

97
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:44,234
with the attribute name of message.

98
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:48,779
I can access it using that same name, message,

99
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,615
and whatever data was placed there,

100
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,307
it'll be displayed right here on the screen.

101
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:54,325
So that's the key there.

102
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,541
So in your controller, you add an attribute

103
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,683
with the given name.

104
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,795
In your JSP page, you can display it

105
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,378
using that same attribute name.

106
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,789
And then finally you may have the question, well,

107
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,033
what if I need to add more data?

108
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,688
What if it's more than just one item?

109
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,447
Well, you can add as much data here

110
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:13,943
as you'd like to the model.

111
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,532
All you do is you simply call addAttribute

112
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,361
X number of times.

113
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:21,116
So in this example, I have, up top I get data.

114
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,623
I have three variables:

115
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,168
results, theStudentList, theShoppingCart.

116
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,608
Then, I can add that data to the model.

117
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,016
I simply say model, addAttribute, message,

118
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:34,315
attribute, student, addAttribute, ShopingCart.

119
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:35,148
So that's it.

120
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,943
So you simply give your name, value pair

121
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:40,194
that you're adding for a given attribute,

122
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:43,041
and you can continue doing that X number of times.

123
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,984
So that's the basic process.

124
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,259
All right, so this is good stuff here.

125
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,415
Let's go ahead and move into Eclipse,

126
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,023
and let's get our hands dirty.

127
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,238
Let's go bang out some code.

128
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:55,071
So I'll see you there.
