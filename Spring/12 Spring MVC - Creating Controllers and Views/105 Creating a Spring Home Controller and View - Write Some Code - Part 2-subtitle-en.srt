1
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:03,496
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:04,562
and run the application.

3
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:06,270
So what I'll do is I'll move to my project folder

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,791
at the root and I'll simply go right click

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,874
and choose run as, and I'll choose run on server.

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,162
So here I'll just choose the default server here

7
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:17,829
and click on finish.

8
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:24,127
So it's gonna start at the server.

9
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,696
And wow, there's our output.

10
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,421
This looks really, really good.

11
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:33,588
So this is our main menu JSP, Spring MVC Demo- Home Page.

12
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:36,830
Ooh, that's awesome, this works.

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,672
So basically our controller in the background

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,027
forwarded the request over to this view page.

15
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:43,355
Awesome, awesome.

16
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:46,160
So let's go dig into the logs here in the console window

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,635
and just take a look at some of the output.

18
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:51,928
Looking at the logs here it says that it's making use

19
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,866
of the spring dispatcher servlet and the initialization

20
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:55,911
has started.

21
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:59,077
So it's starting the process of initializing itself

22
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,494
and reading data.

23
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,795
A couple lines down you can see where it's loading

24
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:09,056
the XML beam definitions from that servlet context file.

25
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,906
That spring MVC demo servlet, dot xml from one

26
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,647
of the previous videos, so that's good.

27
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:19,232
That basically just has component scanning in there.

28
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:21,546
Thanks to component scanning then we'll see

29
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:24,164
that it's gonna actually make, it's gonna actually find

30
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:27,384
our controller, our home controller and map the slash

31
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:30,967
onto a method in our home controller class.

32
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:32,985
So this is great.

33
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:35,140
It says that it's mapping that onto this method,

34
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,466
show page.

35
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,934
Awesome so just like our code laid out.

36
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,096
This is great, good stuff.

37
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,505
Finally down near the bottom this is where we have

38
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,672
that framework servlet dispatcher initialization complete.

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:53,349
So this is basically your success message that hey

40
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,282
spring started up successfully.

41
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,820
It read all of its controllers, did all the mappings.

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,021
There were no issues and the server's up and running

43
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
and ready to go.

44
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:02,687
So this is good.

45
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:06,182
Successful so far in getting our first example running.

46
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,993
Give yourselves a pat on the back.

47
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,850
In some of the following videos we're gonna dive

48
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,100
into more details here with Spring MVC.

49
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:16,394
But hey, this is a good first start.

50
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:19,723
So take a break and get yourself a coffee.

51
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,556
I'll see you in a bit.
