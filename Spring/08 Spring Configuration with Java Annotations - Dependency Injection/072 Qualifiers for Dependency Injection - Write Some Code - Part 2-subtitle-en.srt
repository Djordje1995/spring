1
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:03,125
<v Instructor>All right, so what I'd like to do right now</v>

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:07,292
is actually add code for the Random Fortune Service.

3
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,296
So far in the video series,

4
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:14,131
we've used the HappyFortuneService and it worked fine,

5
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,799
but it was hard-coded with just one fortune every time

6
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:20,356
and we'd like to kind of mix it up a little bit.

7
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:22,729
So let's make use of our Random Fortune Service,

8
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:25,073
and I actually noticed a mistake from the previous videos

9
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:27,263
that it's simply called RandomService.

10
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:30,966
I want to rename it to Random Fortune Service.

11
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,457
So I simply select this class here,

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:36,513
do a right-click and choose Refactor,

13
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:38,596
and then I choose Rename.

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,847
So I'm gonna rename this RandomService

15
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:43,847
to RandomFortuneService.

16
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:48,738
Just being a little specific here, being a little bit anal.

17
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:51,022
I want everything to kind of match up just right.

18
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,515
So I give it that name and I go ahead and hit Finish.

19
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,265
RandomFortuneService.

20
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:57,686
Okay, great.

21
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:00,326
So at this point, Eclipse has updated everything

22
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,229
and we have the basic outline here

23
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,729
for this RandomFortuneService.

24
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:08,938
I'll go ahead and add some comments here

25
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,635
as far as exactly what we need to do during this coding.

26
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:17,802
So first thing is that we need to create an array of strings

27
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,463
and then down in the get Fortune part of it,

28
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:25,630
I'll actually pick a random fortune out of that array.

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,641
So those are the basic comments to myself,

30
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:31,794
just to kind of keep me on track,

31
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:33,310
as far as what I need to do.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,720
And then I'll go ahead and start writing

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,220
some of the Java code to make this happen.

34
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,434
All right, so we'll start here

35
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,678
with setting up an array of strings.

36
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:46,996
And I'll just keep it simple.

37
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,636
I'll just add like three or four strings here,

38
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:53,803
so it's just an array with comma-delimited strings.

39
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,381
All right, so here are my three fortunes here.

40
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:07,367
Beware, diligence, and the journey is the reward.

41
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,021
So again, just keeping it simple.

42
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:11,795
You can get creative and do anything that you'd like here.

43
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,295
Just a basic array of strings.

44
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:19,349
So this is good for part one, so far, so good job.

45
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:23,669
Now I need to have some type of random number generator.

46
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,820
Java provides a built-in random number generator

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,894
and so it's called class Random.

48
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:31,621
So I'll call it myRandom equals new Random.

49
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:34,351
And Random is part of the Java JDK,

50
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,091
so it's in the java.util package.

51
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,758
Simply hover over, do an import on this one.

52
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:43,784
And up top,

53
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,903
you should see the import for,

54
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,005
on line 3, java.util.Random,

55
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,402
so that's part of the standard Java API,

56
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:52,274
which is really cool,

57
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,378
and I'll show you how to use it, too.

58
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,937
Now with this fortune service,

59
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,318
they're gonna call getFortune

60
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,024
when they actually wanna give a fortune.

61
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,429
So we're gonna give them a random fortune from our array.

62
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,508
So the first thing we need to do is, first off,

63
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:08,675
get a random number based on the size of that array.

64
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:15,269
So I'll call this random number here index

65
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,622
and I'll say, index equals random.nextInt,

66
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,872
and it's gonna be based on the size of the array.

67
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:23,037
And again, we can always find out the size of the array

68
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:26,865
by simply saying dot length, so in my case, data.length,

69
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,565
that's, data's the array name, dot length is the attribute

70
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,724
that gives you the size of the array.

71
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,284
And I have a small little typo here.

72
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,053
I should call this, myRandom

73
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,959
because I defined myRandom on line 18.

74
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,975
All right, so basically line 24 gives you a random number

75
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,937
based on the size of the array.

76
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,731
So now I can use that random number

77
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:48,405
to then index into the array and grab a fortune.

78
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:51,527
So here I'll say, data sub index.

79
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:54,348
So then, once I have the fortune, then I return the fortune,

80
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:55,242
and that's it.

81
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,961
So that's the basic implementation here for getFortune.

82
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,720
We basically get a random string from the array,

83
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,887
using our random number generator, simple and plain.

84
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,710
All right, so this class is pretty much ready to go.

85
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,722
So this is our RandomFortuneService.

86
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,975
So let's go ahead and Save this,

87
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,712
and then we can go back and use it

88
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:19,295
in our TennisCoach application.

89
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:27,022
All righty, so moving back over to TennisCoach,

90
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:31,729
and my qualifier here, instead of using happyFortuneService,

91
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,666
I'm gonna tell TennisCoach to now use

92
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,666
my RandomFortuneService.

93
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,505
So I just write out RandomFortuneService and again,

94
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,396
we're using the actual default naming conventions,

95
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:46,196
so it's the same name as the class,

96
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:48,363
first letter is lowercase.

97
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:50,751
All right, that looks good.

98
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,491
So now Spring is actually gonna inject

99
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:56,030
the RandomFortuneService here for the TennisCoach.

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,912
Hm, I'm getting excited, getting excited.

101
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,325
All right, so moving back over to our main application,

102
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:04,444
AnnotationDemoApp, again, this app stays the same,

103
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:05,777
no changes here.

104
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,389
We simply fire this app up by running it.

105
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,972
Say, Run As a Java Application.

106
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:14,873
And booyah!

107
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,199
I love it, look at that!

108
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,114
Diligence is the mother of good luck.

109
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,458
That's one of our random fortunes, this is great.

110
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,896
So, our TennisCoach was injected

111
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:29,864
with our RandomFortuneService, and now that looks good.

112
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:33,897
But let's try it one more time, let's run it one more time.

113
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,812
So I'll hit the green button here on the toolbar

114
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:38,157
to run it again, and take a look at my console,

115
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,157
and oh yeah!

116
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:43,212
Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing.

117
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,132
So we're getting random fortunes.

118
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,033
All right, so when you run it over and over again,

119
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,648
you're gonna get a different fortune every time

120
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,643
because that random number generator

121
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:53,141
is giving us random items.

122
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,058
All right, I'm excited.

123
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,107
Doesn't take much for me to get excited.

124
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,877
I don't know, random numbers, I don't know.

125
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,863
They just kind of do something for me.

126
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,068
All right, so we're good.

127
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,433
So the key here is that

128
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,530
we created another implementation here

129
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,516
of that fortune service and then we put in

130
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,192
a very simple random number implementation,

131
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:15,933
and then we injected that by using that at qualifier

132
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,485
into our Tennis Coach, and we ran it, and everything worked.

133
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,817
This is fun, I love it.

134
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:24,150
All right, good job and congratulations.
