1
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:02,982
<v Instructor>Let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:03,963
and let's get our hands dirty.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,650
Let's write some code.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,370
So looking at our to-do list here,

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,826
or our step-by-step,

6
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:10,295
the first thing we need to do is

7
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:14,128
define the dependency interface and the class.

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,165
And we'll make use of that same dependency from earlier,

9
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:22,432
fortune service and happy fortune service,

10
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:24,509
but we'll go ahead and cut the code again from scratch

11
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,204
just so we're all on track

12
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:28,090
and everything is sinked up.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,665
I'll simply do a right click,

14
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,582
I'll say new interface.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,514
And the name of this interface is FortuneService.

16
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,399
Another name there,

17
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,126
I keep all the other defaults

18
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:42,543
and I hit finish.

19
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:48,294
So at this point I have a very basic fortune service.

20
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,666
There's nothing inside of it.

21
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,390
I'm gonna define just one method here,

22
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,765
this method will be called

23
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:56,682
getFortune.

24
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,529
And open paren, close paren, and a semicolon,

25
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:00,362
and that's it.

26
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:01,374
Somethin' very simple.

27
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:02,597
Not much coding.

28
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:04,559
We like to keep it short

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,976
and we like to keep it sweet.

30
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,720
So there's our fortune service,

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,935
now what we wanna do is actually create a class

32
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,457
that'll actually implement this interface.

33
00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:18,687
So I'll move back over here to my package,

34
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:22,270
I'll do a right click, I'll say new, class.

35
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:30,464
Now the name of this class will be HappyFortuneService.

36
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:34,441
So that's the name and then this class

37
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,598
will actually implement an interface.

38
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,532
So down in the interfaces section,

39
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,858
let's click on that button to the right called add.

40
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,723
And the name of the interface that we're looking for

41
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,706
here is called FortuneService.

42
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,221
So I just type in fortune up top,

43
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,317
you'll get this FortuneService listing there

44
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,725
as a matching item.

45
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:54,549
Then go ahead and hit on the okay button.

46
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,029
So our interfaces section should be updated

47
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,720
with FortuneService.

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,796
Looks good.

49
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:01,127
Let's keep all the other defaults

50
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,794
and let's hit the finish button.

51
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,629
Okay, good.

52
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:06,462
Here we go.

53
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,339
So we have our HappyFortuneService implements

54
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,245
FortuneService,

55
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,118
we're simply gonna give a very basic

56
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,696
implementation here.

57
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:15,251
On line seven, I'll simply say return,

58
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,501
and I will say today is your lucky day.

59
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:22,127
And I'll add the double quote there

60
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,014
and that's it.

61
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:26,327
So that's a basic implementation here of this

62
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:27,994
HappyFortuneService.

63
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:30,318
This looks good.

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,736
Now the one thing that we're gonna do different

65
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,457
that we didn't do earlier in the videos

66
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,301
is that we're gonna add this @Component annotation.

67
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:39,384
Remember Spring will scan our package

68
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,331
and it'll register all components.

69
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,110
So we want this HappyFortuneService

70
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,365
to be a component that's registered.

71
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:50,532
That looks good and I think we're in good shape so far.

72
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:00,066
Now the next thing we wanna do is we wanna enhance

73
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,512
our coach interface.

74
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:04,223
We actually wanna add a method to the coach interface.

75
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:07,232
Right now the coach can give us daily workouts

76
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,184
but we also want the coach to be able to give us

77
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:12,294
our daily fortune.

78
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:13,680
So in coach dot java,

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm gonna add a new method here called

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,867
GetDailyFortune that returns a string.

81
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,514
And that's it.

82
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:24,258
We keep it very simple for right now.

83
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,165
Okay, great.

84
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,516
This looks good so far.

85
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:27,349
Good job.
