1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,926 line:15% 
<v Instructor>Well, one thing that I just noticed</v>

2
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:05,460 line:15% 
is that we actually broke the TennisCoach class

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,627 line:15% 
that implements Coach,

4
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:08,882 line:15% 
because we added a new method in Coach,

5
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:12,260 line:15% 
but we didn't add that new method to TennisCoach.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,472 line:15% 
So let's go ahead and fix this now.

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,701 line:15% 
So I'll move into my TennisCoach class,

8
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,287
I'll kinda hover over the error,

9
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,177
and Eclipse can actually help us out.

10
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,544
So we can choose that option there

11
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,669
to Add unimplemented methods,

12
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:28,169
and that's the method for getDailyFortune.

13
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,750
So down on lines 13 through 17,

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,580
this is where Eclipse just added that new method for us.

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,270
Just a stub, just a skeleton.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,098
We'll fix it up later.

17
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:44,265
But at least it resolved that compilation issue that we had.

18
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,504
Now one thing I wanna do right now is just

19
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:53,429
set up a little private field for the FortuneService,

20
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,458
and we'll actually set it, or inject it, later.

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:59,625
But for now, simply list it out here, FortuneService.

22
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:04,880
And then, down in my getDailyFortune method,

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,152
I'll actually use this FortuneService.

24
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:10,735
So here I'll say FortuneService.getFortune.

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,979
All right, this is great, but now you may have noticed

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,113
that we haven't actually initialized the FortuneService yet,

27
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:24,741
that's not really taken care of.

28
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,763
And we'll take care of that part of it in the next step,

29
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:31,096
when we cover our constructor injection.

30
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:36,227
All right, so in Step 2 we need to create a constructor

31
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:38,168
in our class for injections,

32
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:41,712
and also we'll need to add in the Autowired annotation,

33
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:45,500
but we'll kinda do this step by step.

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,407 line:15% 
All right, so Step 2, creating a constructor.

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,240 line:15% 
So again,

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,838 line:15% 
the constructor is always the same name as the class,

37
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,292 line:15% 
so our class is called TennisCoach,

38
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,869 line:15% 
so our constructor will be called TennisCoach.

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,384 line:15% 
And I'll just kinda write it out longhand.

40
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,075 line:15% 
I'll say FortuneService theFortuneService,

41
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,147 line:15% 
and internally I'll simply assign it.

42
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:05,314 line:15% 
So I'll assign fortuneService = theFortuneService;

43
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,671 line:15% 
All right, so we basically just assigned

44
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,823 line:15% 
the parameter being passed in to a field

45
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,174 line:15% 
that we have here in our TennisCoach class.

46
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,341 line:15% 
So this looks good so far.

47
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:19,059 line:15% 
So now we need to do Step 3,

48
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,513 line:15% 
configure dependency injection

49
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:23,013 line:15% 
with the Autowired annotation.

50
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:25,485 line:15% 
Then we can simply go through

51
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,318 line:15% 
and fix the imports here for that.

52
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:34,732 line:15% 
And up top, on line 3,

53
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:37,109 line:15% 
we should have the proper import pulled in,

54
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:38,692 line:15% 
so this looks good.

55
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,978
Okay great, so now we have this constructor injection

56
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,711
with the Autowired annotation,

57
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,767
so for our Coach, they're gonna inject a FortuneService.

58
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,676 line:15% 
So remember, Spring is gonna scan for a component

59
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,627 line:15% 
that implements the FortuneService interface.

60
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:57,772 line:15% 
So in our example, that's the HappyFortuneService,

61
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:59,723 line:15% 
it'll actually meet that requirement.

62
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:01,386 line:15% 
Spring will create an instance of it,

63
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:05,136 line:15% 
and then inject it here into our TennisCoach.

64
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:10,355 line:15% 
All right, now let's move over to our main program here,

65
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:13,158 line:15% 
our AnnotationDemoApp.java.

66
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,579 line:15% 
Take a quick look at that one.

67
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,521
So this is where we actually read in the config file,

68
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:19,915
we get the container,

69
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,579
we actually get the bean from the container,

70
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,015
and then we call methods on it.

71
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:23,848
Now what I wanna do

72
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:27,282
is actually make use of some of those new methods,

73
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:31,449
or that new method that I added, to get the daily fortune.

74
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:36,490
So here I'll simply say sysout.println,

75
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,657
and I'll say theCoach.getDailyFortune.

76
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,295
So this is great.

77
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,621
So now we're using that new method,

78
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,101
and that new implementation,

79
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,487
and the fortune is actually being supported

80
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,670
by the FortuneService dependency, our helper,

81
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,253
that's giving us all of our happy fortunes.

82
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,547
So again, just a quick recap here on this AnnotationDemoApp.

83
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,156
Again, our main driver,

84
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,645
we simply read the spring config file,

85
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,273
we get the bean from the container,

86
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:07,205
call a method,

87
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,816
and then call the daily fortune method,

88
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,649
finally cleanup.

89
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,610
So that's just a recap

90
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,475
of what we had from some of the previous videos here.

91
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,233
All right, so we can save everything,

92
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,365
and then we can right click,

93
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:20,032
and we can choose Run As a Java Application.

94
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:25,230
And here's the output, and yeah!

95
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,067
Today's my lucky day.

96
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,678
So we read the config file,

97
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,795
applicationContext.xml does the auto-scanning,

98
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,580
we print out our daily workout,

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,939
"Practice your backhand volley".

100
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,856
And then this new item here, which is really cool:

101
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:38,822
"Today is your lucky day!"

102
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,320
That's our fortune.

103
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,549
Yeah! I'm lucky today.

104
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,206
So that's being actually handled by the dependency,

105
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,000
so they're actually injecting

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,639
our FortuneService implementation, HappyFortuneService,

107
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,503
and now our Coach, or our TennisCoach,

108
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,585
can actually use that to provide the desired output.

109
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:57,465
So this is great.

110
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:58,501
I'm excited.

111
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,581
I'm fired up.

112
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,740
And you should be happy too,

113
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,683
'cause now you're doing dependency of injection

114
00:05:04,683 --> 00:05:07,444
with Spring Annotations.

115
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:09,586
You can check that box off,

116
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,146
and you can go brag to your friends

117
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:16,640
of all this great stuff that you're learning.

118
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,236
All right, I'm having too much fun.

119
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:21,736
But anyways, good job and congratulations.
