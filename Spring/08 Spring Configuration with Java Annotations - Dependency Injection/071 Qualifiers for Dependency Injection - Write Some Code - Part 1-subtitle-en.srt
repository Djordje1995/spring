1
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:02,978
<v Instructor>Let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:02,978 --> 00:00:05,873
and let's actually build out those Multiple Fortune

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,472
Service Implementations.

4
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:09,560
So we'll create all these other services

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,211
like Random, Database, and RESTFortune

6
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,065
and we'll stub them out

7
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,562
and then we'll test it out and see our error message.

8
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:17,597
So here's our interface FortuneService

9
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:20,038
and we already have HappyFortuneService.

10
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:22,120
We've been using that so far in the video series.

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,090
Let's go ahead and create another Fortune Service.

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,423
So let me right click and say New Class.

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,358
And this will actually be the class

14
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:36,108
for my RandomService.

15
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,157
So I'll just give the name of RandomService.

16
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,719
And then down that interface, I'll click

17
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,205
on the Add button and I'll choose FortuneService.

18
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,383
I'll just type it in the top.

19
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:49,061
Fortune, and select FortuneService.

20
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:50,541
That's the interface that we're gonna implement.

21
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,116
Again, we're creating multiple

22
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,898
FortuneService implementations.

23
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:56,910
Hit Okay, I'll keep all the other defaults here.

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,628
And I'll hit Finish.

25
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,200
Okay, so here's our RandomService

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,509
and let's go ahead and add the Add Component there,

27
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:06,428
so spring will handle the component scanning for us.

28
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:10,428
And just hover over it and fix the import there.

29
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,060
And there we go.

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,060
So line three, we should have the import

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,700
for Spring component.

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,533
Okay, great.

33
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,942
So now this RandomService is set up

34
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:26,693
for auto scanning with our spring application.

35
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,104
Good job.

36
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,297
Now we're kind of gonna, we're gonna go through

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,841
and actually repeat the process for the other

38
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,954
service implementations.

39
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:34,339
So do right click,

40
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:35,672
I say New Class.

41
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,986
And for this one, this will be our database

42
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,246
FortuneService and again,

43
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,174
we'll just stub it out.

44
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,060
We're not gonna do any real database stuff now.

45
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,676
We'll just stub it out for now.

46
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:48,509
Move down to interfaces and I'll click on Add.

47
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,388
And again, I'll choose my FortuneService

48
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,221
there from the list

49
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,138
as far as my interface.

50
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:59,088
And then I'll hit Okay.

51
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,001
Keep all the other defaults

52
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,251
and hit Finish.

53
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,983
Alright, so there's my DatabaseFortuneService.

54
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,171
I'll go ahead and keep that stub.

55
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,004
Now let's create one more service.

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,342
So I'll just do a right click.

57
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,825
I'll say New.

58
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,408
And I'll say Class.

59
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,384
And this will be my RESTFortune Service.

60
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:26,202
Again, we're just stubbing this out.

61
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,619
Move down to interfaces.

62
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:29,869
And choose Add.

63
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:34,690
And again, choose a FortuneService interface.

64
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,523
Hit Okay.

65
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:39,275
All the other defaults, hit Finish.

66
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:42,337
Okay, great.

67
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,924
So now I have four FortuneService implementations

68
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:48,002
right now in my application.

69
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,024
So this kind of matches with the diagram

70
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,898
that we had a little bit earlier.

71
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:52,898
So good job.

72
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:59,124
So now let's move back over to our TennisCoach.

73
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,516
Our TennisCoach is set up

74
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:03,840
for auto wire and they'll auto wire a FortuneService.

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,683
For right now, I'm gonna leave it plain vanilla.

76
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:07,096
I'm not gonna make any changes.

77
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,987
I actually wanna run it and see the error message

78
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:12,896
first and then we'll actually come back and fix it later.

79
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,751
So let's go ahead and move back over to our main

80
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,668
application, our AnnotationDemoApp.

81
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,031
And we'll keep this app exactly the same.

82
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,560
We won't make any changes here.

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,589
It'll simply read the configs, get the container,

84
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,381
and now I'll just simply run this application.

85
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,798
Just a right click and run as a Java app.

86
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,790
And let's expand the console window

87
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,123
and oh, yucky, yucky, yucky.

88
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,283
We see the exception.

89
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,151
The same one we saw from the slides.

90
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,984
Ugh.

91
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,429
Just all this ugly statuary stuff.

92
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:47,262
So the auto,

93
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,595
the injection of the auto wire failed.

94
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:51,681
Okay, all this stuff.

95
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:52,607
All this stuff.

96
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,440
Ugh.

97
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:58,381
So, cannot auto wire field blah, blah, blah.

98
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,520
Blah, blah, blah.

99
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,697
It's all bad news, right?

100
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,379
(laughs)

101
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,272
So here it said,

102
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:06,626
Expecting a single matching bean

103
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,170
but found two.

104
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,572
Wait, wait, two?

105
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:10,405
Happy for rent,

106
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:12,224
wait, what's up with that?

107
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:13,521
Two?

108
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,259
We had four.

109
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,092
Ugh.

110
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,635
Now I'm really sad.

111
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,838
Actually, I'm mad.

112
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,171
What's going on?

113
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:24,814
Let's see, oh!

114
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:26,591
Duh.

115
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,424
Okay, great.

116
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,435
You see the problem, the mistake I made?

117
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,211
You probably caught this earlier, right?

118
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,966
I forgot to add the @Component annotation.

119
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,848
So Spring wouldn't auto-scan these guys.

120
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,116
So it never saw these guys.

121
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:41,472
That's why DatabaseFortuneService

122
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,681
was never there.

123
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:43,514
Ooh, okay.

124
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,801
My mistake.

125
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,399
So that's fixed and I think I made the same mistake

126
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,232
over here.

127
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,065
Yeah.

128
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:49,898
RESTFortune.

129
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:50,731
Ugh.

130
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:52,627
Okay, so need to add @Component.

131
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,715
Ayay-yah.

132
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:54,763
But I'm glad you caught that.

133
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:56,175
You probably caught that during the video

134
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,503
and you sat there and you waited for me

135
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:00,253
to make this mistake.

136
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:02,465
So good eagle eye on your part

137
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:03,935
for catching that.

138
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:04,768
But we went through,

139
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,002
we solved it.

140
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:09,719
Let's save all those files and now let's go back to our

141
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,552
main app and run it one more time.

142
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:16,659
So back in our main application.

143
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:19,159
And right click and run it as.

144
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,620
Alright, so it's running.

145
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,766
We got our console output.

146
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:26,599
Okay, good.

147
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:27,711
So all the ugly stuff before,

148
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,573
all the blah, blah, blah,

149
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:30,860
blah, blah, blah.

150
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,257
But at least we get the error message

151
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,107
we were looking for.

152
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:33,940
(laughs)

153
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,624
We're actually happy to get this error message down.

154
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:39,251
It said that single matching bean but found

155
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,084
four.

156
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:40,917
Okay, good.

157
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,889
Alright, so now we broke it the way I

158
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:43,755
planned on breaking it.

159
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,463
(laughs)

160
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:46,296
Okay, good.

161
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:47,985
Database, happy, random, Rest.

162
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,370
Alright, so basically Spring says,

163
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,098
"Hey, I don't know which one of these beans

164
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:51,931
"to use.

165
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,108
"Which one of these implementations to use

166
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,644
"because they're all perfect candidates here

167
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,001
"for this auto wiring."

168
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,828
So again, write the solution and be specific.

169
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:00,661
Alright?

170
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,578
So we need to go back into our Tenniscoach

171
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:06,115
and we need to use that @Qualifier

172
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,695
and I need to give the actual bean ID

173
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,806
of the bean that I want spring to use.

174
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:12,161
I'll say, "Hey, I want you to use

175
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,225
"the HappyFortuneService."

176
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,853
And so I use the bean ID

177
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,654
which is the same name as the class,

178
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:19,226
first letter, lower case

179
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:21,838
because we're using the default naming image.

180
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,468
Alright, this looks good.

181
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,051
This looks really, really good.

182
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,489
Alright, so let's go ahead and run this now.

183
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,839
Back into our main application,

184
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,862
Annotation Demo App.

185
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,862
And now just right click and run it.

186
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,947
And we're up and running

187
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:41,864
and booyah!

188
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,690
Back to normal.

189
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,335
Okay?

190
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,135
Practice your back hand volley

191
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:49,736
and today is your lucky day.

192
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,161
That's the fortune that we get from our

193
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,931
HappyFortuneService.

194
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:54,828
All those other implementations are stub out

195
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:55,661
right now.

196
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:56,494
They simply return null,

197
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:59,253
but this guy gives us our desired output.

198
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,114
So it's using our HappyFortuneService.

199
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,559
So yay!

200
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,950
Good job.

201
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,850
We resolved it and how do we resolve it?

202
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,933
By being specific with our @Qualifier Annotation.

203
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:12,337
Yoo-hoo!
