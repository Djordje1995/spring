<v Narrator>Hey, so I wanna give you a quick video</v>

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:05,213
regarding the different injection types.

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,079
So, we covered constructor injection.

4
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:10,263
We also looked at how to do setter injection

5
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:13,079
and finally, we discussed field injection.

6
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:17,239
You may wonder well, which one should I use?

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,957
So, I always say, choose a style and stay consistent

8
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:23,888
within your project, alright.

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:26,114
And, that'll make things easy for you, but also make

10
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:29,219
it easy for other team members on your project

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,221
if it's one consistent approach throughout.

12
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,500
Now, you may wonder, is one injection type better

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,209
than the other?

14
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,743
Well, you get the same functionality regardless

15
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,063
of either injection type that you use.

16
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,938
So, constructor, setter, field you get

17
00:00:43,938 --> 00:00:45,489
the same functionality.

18
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,198
So, again, choose one injection type that you

19
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,234
feel comfortable with you like to use

20
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:54,242
and then make use of that in your application.

21
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:56,807
So, full disclosure, I'll go ahead and tell you now

22
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,640
that you'll see certain blog posts out there

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,635
written by certain Spring fans boys or fan girls

24
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:04,415
where they will taut a specific injection type

25
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,808
as being superior to all.

26
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:10,008
Now, this is a very debatable topic.

27
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:13,399
I always joke, it's kinda like a religious argument.

28
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:16,143
There's no right or wrong answer,

29
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,186
even in the Spring documentation they state

30
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:20,197
that with the injection types you pretty much

31
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:23,250
get the same functionality across the board.

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,015
So again, just choose the type that works best

33
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:28,886
for your team or what your team is more comfortable with

34
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,783
seeing and then simply stay consistent

35
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:33,020
throughout your project.

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,075
Alright, just a quick video.

37
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,998
I know you may have had questions about that

38
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:37,772
and I wanted to give you just a quick answer

39
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,104
to help you out.

40
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:42,437
Alright, I'll see you in the next video.
