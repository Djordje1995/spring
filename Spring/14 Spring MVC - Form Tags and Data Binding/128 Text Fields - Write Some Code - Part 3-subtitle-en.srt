00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,928 line:15% 
<v ->Alrighty, so we're making some really good progress here.</v>

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:08,905 line:15% 
So, our final step here was creating the confirmation page,

3
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,145 line:15% 
so we simply want to display the information

4
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,633 line:15% 
on the webpage as far as what the user entered.

5
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,505 line:15% 
So we'll create this file here called student confirmation.

6
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,407
So let me swing back over to the directories here

7
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,259
on the web view and I'll just do

8
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,897
a right click on this folder and I'll say

9
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:24,730
new file.

10
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,555
An actual name of the file,

11
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,638
I'll call it studentconfirmation.jsp.

12
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:37,081
I'll hit finish, and actually what I want to do is

13
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,775
copy some of the basic html stuff

14
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,374 line:15% 
from our other student form,

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,785 line:15% 
I don't want to type it all again.

16
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:44,966 line:15% 
I'm getting a little lazy here,

17
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:49,368 line:15% 
so I'll just copy all the doctype header body stuff.

18
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,230 line:15% 
Just do a copy on that

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,250 line:15% 
and I'll just swing over to my confirmation page

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,352
and just do a paste

21
00:00:56,352 --> 00:01:00,516
and then I'll just do a /body/html there.

22
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:01,701
Cool. Alright, good.

23
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,289
So, that's the basics there and instead of

24
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,641
student registration form,

25
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,141
I'll say student confirmation.

26
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:10,665
Cool.

27
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:13,928
So it takes care of all the regular stuff.

28
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:15,063
Now, I simply want to give the

29
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:17,165 line:15% 
confirmation message here.

30
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:20,204 line:15% 
So I'll say, "The student is confirmed."

31
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:21,763 line:15% 
And basically I need to give the student's

32
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:23,392 line:15% 
first name and last name.

33
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,316 line:15% 
So I use the dollar sign curly brace

34
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,272 line:15% 
student.firstName then a space with

35
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:32,487 line:15% 
dollar sign curly brace student.lastName.

36
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,790 line:15% 
So again, remember here, they'll simply

37
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,873 line:15% 
call student.getFirstName

38
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:43,330
and likewise they'll call student.getLastName.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,017
That will give us the output here

40
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,399
for this confirmation page,

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,086
which you've seen all this before,

42
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,971
this is really simple for you now.

43
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,274
You're an expert now.

44
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,357
This is easy. Easy, easy.

45
00:01:54,373 --> 00:01:55,596
Alright good, so this looks really good.

46
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:57,156
We're in good shape.

47
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,508
I think we're at the point where

48
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:59,682
we can actually go through and

49
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,774
test out the application.

50
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:03,708
Actually, there's one thing I wanna do.

51
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,876
I wanna go back and actually change our main menu.

52
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,205
I wanna add a link there to the main menu

53
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:11,889
to point to this new form that we just created,

54
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,718 line:15% 
so let's go ahead and open up main-menu.jsp

55
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,126 line:15% 
and update our links.

56
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,222 line:15% 
So here it is.

57
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,630 line:15% 
So we currently have a link for the Hello World form,

58
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,580 line:15% 
I'll add some BRs, some line breaks here.

59
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,086
I'll copy this href from line 10.

60
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:29,148
I'll paste it on line 14

61
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:32,000
and now instead of Hello, this will be

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,167
student/showForm and I'll call it student form.

63
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:39,638
So on our main menu, we simply have

64
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,805
a link that will take us directly to our student form.

65
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,615
Alright, so this is really shaping up

66
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:47,967
to be a nice little app.

67
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm happy.

68
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,974
I'm happy I'm getting excited.

69
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:54,875
I think I can start running it now, yeah.

70
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,254
Alright, let's go ahead and move to our app.

71
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:59,514
Let's bring the MDC demo, right click,

72
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,681
choose run as, and then run on server.

73
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,339
Alright, so the app is up.

74
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:09,165
There's our new link for our student form.

75
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:12,082
Let's go ahead and click that link.

76
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,471
Shows our form, so we just enter

77
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:21,984
our first name and our last name, John Doe.

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,651
And let's hit the submit button.

79
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,409
Cool, so there's our confirmation page,

80
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,017
the student is confirmed.

81
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:33,185
Now we've done a lot of this stuff earlier in the class,

82
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,448
but now we're actually making use of

83
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,606
Spring MVC Form Tags and we're also making use of

84
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:41,773
@ModelAttribute to bind form data to java objects.

85
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:44,676
And that's really cool.

86
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:48,008
We're making use of this data binding here in Spring.

87
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,488
Oh and also let's take a peek here

88
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,728
at our output for our controller.

89
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,455
So, when we log that information,

90
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,465
it's showing up right here in the console window

91
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,143
for that controller output,

92
00:03:58,143 --> 00:03:59,998
so this is cool also.

93
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm happy, I'm excited.

94
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,112
So we kind of walked through this whole

95
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,032
developmental process and we did it step by step.

96
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:07,805
So we created our student class, controller,

97
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,164
form, processing code, and finally,

98
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,138
our confirmation page.

99
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:14,506
So, good job with everything.

100
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:15,339
Woohoo.
