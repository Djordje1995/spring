1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:03,085
<v Narrator>Alright let's move into Eclipse.</v>

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,677
With our development process we're gonna update the form.

3
00:00:05,677 --> 00:00:09,130
Update the Student class and our confirmation page.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,722
So the first thing here is updating the form.

5
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:13,709
We've kind of gone through this drill before so it's

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,897
going to be very familiar to you so far.

7
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:19,064
So I'll just open up student-form.jsp.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,825
So basically what I'm going to do here

9
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:27,763
is add a new entry here for our radio buttons

10
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:30,080
So I'll add another &lt;br&gt; here.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,247
I'll just copy-paste line 31 and paste it on line 34.

12
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,673
Alright so what we'll do here is we'll set up

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,052
for our favorite language.

14
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,802
And then we'll set up our &lt;form:radiobutton&gt;.

15
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:51,603
And I'll set the path="favoritLanguage".

16
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:53,670
That's a property that we're gonna bind to our Java class

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,753
with getters and setters.

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,748
And then I'll set the value="Java".

19
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:03,970
Alright that's the basics there.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,694
So again, remember when we submit on this form

21
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:10,516
they'll call student.setFavoriteLanguage and then I'll

22
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:12,683
pass in the selected item.

23
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:16,635
Alright cool, so let me just copy-paste line 35

24
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,175
x number of times.

25
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:21,058
I'm just copying that Java line and I'll just paste it

26
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,143
x number of times for the other languages here.

27
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:24,893
For C#, PHP and Ruby.

28
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:30,098
Just give me one quick second here I'll speed the video up

29
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:34,265
while I update the values here for C#, PHP and Ruby.

30
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,640
So we're kinda in good shape here.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,036
So that's our radio button for favorite language.

32
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:46,507
Again remember, when they submit the data they're gonna call

33
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,840
student.setFavoriteLanguage.

34
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,694
I'm kind of happy here.

35
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:56,570
This looks good so far for our HTML form.

36
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,602
Alright so I'll save everything.

37
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:01,169
And now we need to move over to step two.

38
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:06,159
That's actually creating a property in our Student Class.

39
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,817
So we're gonna create a property here

40
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,760
for this favorite language.

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,836
We'll actually provide getter and setter methods

42
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,336
for that property.

43
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:23,283
So here I'll say private String favoriteLanguage.

44
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:25,533
So that's our actual field.

45
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,022
Then I'll scroll down a bit.

46
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:35,024
And right click here generate getters and setters.

47
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:39,191
So right click -&gt; Source -&gt; Generate Getters and Setters.

48
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,317
You know how to do all this stuff by now.

49
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:43,780
I don't even have to say anything.

50
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,491
You know what to do already.

51
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,846
You're an expert at this.

52
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:50,606
Alright so I'll just select both the options here.

53
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:54,276
Actually select the one option for favoriteLanguage.

54
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,176
And that'll generate the getter and setters

55
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,974
for favoriteLanguage.

56
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:00,090
Then I'll just hit ok.

57
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,149
Alright, so there we go.

58
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:03,910
Lines 57 through 63 getter/setter methods

59
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,660
for favoriteLanguage.

60
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:09,440
Alright so this looks good so far.

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,997
So let's go ahead and move up to our next step.

62
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,439
That's simply updating the confirmation page.

63
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,076
And again we're simply just gonna echo whatever the user

64
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:19,558
selected from the form.

65
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,871
So on my confirmation page I just need to add one more

66
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:24,426
little line break so I'll copy line 13.

67
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:28,359
Paste it here on line 17 and then I'll say Favorite Language

68
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,192
and again use the ${student.favoriteLanguage}.

69
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,133
And again you probably beat me typing that.

70
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,549
You already knew the answer.

71
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,631
So again, when here Spring will actually call

72
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:43,052
student.getFavoriteLanguage() cause we're simply displaying

73
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,219
the data here.

74
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:48,524
So this looks good, I'm happy so far.

75
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,503
So let's go ahead and run this application.

76
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:58,346
So I'll simply right click -&gt; Run As -&gt; Run on Server.

77
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,961
Zoom in a bit.

78
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,878
Click on the link for Student Form.

79
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:09,294
And we have our languages listed here at the bottom.

80
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:12,007
Radio buttons can only choose one.

81
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,257
Which language will I pick?

82
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:21,312
I'll fill in my other information here for the student.

83
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,241
And I'll hit submit.

84
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,261
And so there we go.

85
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,678
So student is confirmed, John Doe.

86
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,672
Favorite language of C#.

87
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:30,844
So this looks great.

88
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,551
Everything works kinda as desired.

89
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:36,375
So we can read radio buttons with Spring MVC.

90
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,958
Using those form tags and the data binding.
