1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,138
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so let's go ahead and run this.</v>

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:04,188
This looks pretty good right now.

3
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:05,457
So I'll simply right click.

4
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:07,874
Choose run as, run on server.

5
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:11,851
All right, and so my app's up and running.

6
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,635
Go ahead and select the item there for student form.

7
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,479
I can enter some basic information there

8
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,664
for first name, last name.

9
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:22,073
Now, for operating systems, I'm gonna choose Linux and Mac,

10
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:24,545
so I'm choosing multiple operating systems here.

11
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,721
And I'll go ahead and hit submit.

12
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:27,554
And boom.

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,982
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:31,982
What the, happened here?

15
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,091
Oh, this is terrible.

16
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:38,205
This is awful.

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,109
What happened?

18
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:39,942
Ah.

19
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,617
It said operationSystems.

20
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:44,450
Ew.

21
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:46,737
Typo, young man.

22
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:47,570
Typo.

23
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,660
You know why, right?

24
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:54,649
You already, you saw this earlier.

25
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:55,744
And you caught it earlier.

26
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:56,577
And your code is fixed.

27
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:59,398
And your code is working, but mine's broken.

28
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,702
It's not working.

29
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:01,535
Ah.

30
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,451
So it's not operationSystems.

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,906
It's actually operatingSystems.

32
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:10,750
All right, that's my problem.

33
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,590
I didn't use the right property name.

34
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,124
So operationSystems.

35
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,020
That's bad.

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,103
That's wrong, very wrong.

37
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,997
'Cause if we look at our student.Java,

38
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,067
they're gonna call set operatingSystems,

39
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,994
but you know, there's a getter and a setter,

40
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:30,515
and there's no such thing as operationSystems.

41
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,753
It's operating.

42
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:33,420
I can't spell, blah.

43
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:35,377
All right.

44
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:37,192
So as developers, right, we waste most of our time

45
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,942
not on logic errors.

46
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:43,175
We waste most of our time on configuration errors and typos.

47
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:44,479
(laughs)

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,786
All right, so let's go ahead and fix that, operatingSystems.

49
00:01:48,786 --> 00:01:51,964
So spring will call student.getOperatingSystems

50
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:54,315
to actually retrieve that data.

51
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,897
So that's what was going on there.

52
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:56,730
Ah.

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,313
Well, at least we fixed it.

54
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:00,448
That's the good thing.

55
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:03,052
I hate errors, but at least I like to solve 'em,

56
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,804
so I can continue moving on with my development.

57
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:08,363
All right, so I've saved that.

58
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:12,040
Now, if I simply go on back, and I'll just,

59
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,402
forms are already set up ready to go.

60
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,881
Let's just cross our fingers, and hit submit.

61
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,298
And boom, yeah, success baby.

62
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:22,986
Linux, Mac OS, that's great.

63
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:24,709
So it's working.

64
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,416
So we're looping over those operating systems.

65
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,594
That's like an array, and we're using

66
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:30,367
that JSTL for each tag.

67
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,016
And we're displaying our output.

68
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:33,954
I love it.

69
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:34,871
I'm happy.
