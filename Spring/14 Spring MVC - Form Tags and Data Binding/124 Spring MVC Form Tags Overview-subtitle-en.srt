00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:02,307
<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:05,724
we're gonna discuss Spring MVC form tags.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,977
So we all know about html forms, right?

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,640
Basically if you have to log into a system,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,715
you have to enter your information via a form,

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,415
or if you use like a travel site

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,212
to travel from a given city to a destination,

8
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:19,958
you make use of a form.

9
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,158
So we'll learn how to use forms with Spring.

10
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:24,173
And in particular,

11
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:27,324
Spring has support for form tags,

12
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,947
and these are form tags that are configurable,

13
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,947
and you can reuse them on a webpage.

14
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:35,587
Now you may wonder,

15
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:37,997
"Well we've already created forms using Spring."

16
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,891
Well these Spring MVC form tags,

17
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,875
they give you an extra support.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,842
They support data binding,

19
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,683
so this allows you to automatically set data

20
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:50,223
and retrieve data from Java objects and beans.

21
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:53,355
All right, so let's take a look at the Spring MVC form tags.

22
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:56,903
These form tags will actually generate html for you,

23
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:00,126
so they'll do a lot of the heavy lifting behind the scenes.

24
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,197
There's also some other special features that they'll add.

25
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,108
I'll talk about that in a second.

26
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,342
But basically here's a list of the tags.

27
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:09,261
So you have the main form tag,

28
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:12,378
and you also have the input tag for text fields.

29
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,219
There's a text area for multi-line text fields,

30
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,260
check box, radio buttons,

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,296
and there's also the select tag for doing a drop down list.

32
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:21,721
And there's many more.

33
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,756
So in this video series,

34
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:25,002
I'll cover the most commonly used form tags,

35
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,670
and you'll see it all in operation

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,346
and we'll write all the code from scratch

37
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:31,079
and we'll do it all step by step.

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,376
If you'd like to get more documentation on these tags,

39
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:34,837
you can simply go to my website here,

40
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:38,261
luv2code.com/spring-mvc-form-tags,

41
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:41,109
and I'll redirect you to the official documentation

42
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,526
for the Spring MVC form tags.

43
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:48,254
All right, now how's the web page structure set up?

44
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,937
Well you basically make use of a normal JSP page

45
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:54,180
and then you simply drop in the Spring MVC form tags.

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,149
So you have your regular html stuff,

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,622
Spring MVC form tags,

48
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:58,948
and then more html.

49
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,333
So you can easily mix 'em in

50
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,878
to your existing web page content.

51
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:07,195
Now how do you reference these tags in the JSP file?

52
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,940
Well basically at the beginning of your file,

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,879
you make use of this tag lib reference.

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,264
You have prefix equals form,

55
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,578
and then you give the uri

56
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,199
and solicit here on the slide.

57
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,542
And once you have that set up,

58
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:20,709
then you can make use of those tags on the JSP page.

59
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,863
All right, so that's an overview

60
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:24,367
of the Spring MVC form tags.

61
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,337
In the following videos,

62
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,477
we'll start to drill down into some of the tags,

63
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:29,149
then we'll set 'em up and see how they work

64
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,772
and just test 'em out.

65
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:33,689
So I'll see you in the next video.
