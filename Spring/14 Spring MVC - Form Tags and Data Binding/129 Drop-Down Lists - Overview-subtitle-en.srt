<v Instructor>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:06,910
we'll cover the Spring MVC form tag for drop Down list.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,859
So here's just a quick review

4
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:12,134
of the original HTML &lt;select&gt; tag.

5
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:15,216
You can have a form that has a dropdown list.

6
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:18,950
A user can go through and select their favorite country

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,117
and then hit submit.

8
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,158
So I have India selected here.

9
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:25,328
In the bottom right, that's the original HTML text

10
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:28,529
that you would use for displaying this dropdown list,

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,196
simply a &lt;select&gt; tag with multiple options.

12
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:36,560
Now in the Spring MVC world,

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,727
the dropdown list is represented by the tag &lt;form:select&gt;.

14
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:46,287
So let's take a look at how to use the &lt;form:select&gt;.

15
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:48,921
Basically, you specify the path that this binds to.

16
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,159
In this case, &lt;form:select path="country"&gt;,

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,709
and then you give your options,

18
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,333
and you give the value labels.

19
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,469
The label is what the user will actually see on the screen.

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,634
The value is the actual code that you'll pass over

21
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:01,826
when they submit it.

22
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,263
In this case, my values and labels are the same,

23
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,055
but your value can easily be a code,

24
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:09,749
like the three letter country code for a given country.

25
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:12,393
But that's basically how you use the dropdown list

26
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:13,560
in Spring MVC.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,344
Alright, so let's go ahead and pull it all together.

28
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,099
We'll have a student form.

29
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,120
We'll basically add a dropdown list to that form.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,509
We're gonna send it over to our student controller,

31
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,584
which will in turn pass it across to the confirmation page,

32
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,544
and once we're on the confirmation page,

33
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:32,915
we'll simply display the value

34
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:36,311
that the user selected from that dropdown list.

35
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,993
Okay, so we'll move into the clips,

36
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,549
and we'll do all this from scratch,

37
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,176
and we'll get our hands dirty.

38
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:44,176
So I will see you in the next video.
