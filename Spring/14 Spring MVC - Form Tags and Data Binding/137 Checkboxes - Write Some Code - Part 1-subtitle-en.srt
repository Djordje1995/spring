1
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,707
<v Chad>Alrighty, so let's go ahead dive into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:03,707 --> 00:00:05,611
and we'll follow that same process.

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,414
We'll update the form, we'll update our class, and then

4
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:11,367
finally update the confirmation page so again

5
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,367
you guys kind of see the development process

6
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,305
that we're using here.

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,985
And you're getting used to it by now.

8
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:17,889
So let's go ahead and open up our form.

9
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,638
On our form what we're going to do is actually

10
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,448
add checkboxes here for the

11
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:24,781
different operating systems.

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,309
And then we'll make use of that form:checkbox.

13
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,569
So let me just move it down to line 40.

14
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:34,685
I'll just copy that BR there

15
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:37,036
and I'll paste it here.

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,740
Now what I want to do is basically just give a

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,740
label here saying operating systems.

18
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:47,828
And then I'll just add some entries here

19
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,341
for the different OSs.

20
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,968
Like Linux, I'll say form:checkbox.

21
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,656
I'll give path equal.

22
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:58,389
This is going to bind to operating systems.

23
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,639
And the value equals Linux.

24
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,401
What I'll do is I'll actually copy this line

25
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,942
X number of times.

26
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,578
And again remember, they're going to call

27
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,744
student.setOperatingSystems.

28
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:15,081
So I'll just copy that line and I'll paste it.

29
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,915
Then I'll just make some quick updates here for Mac

30
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:24,082
and also a quick update here for Microsoft Windows.

31
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,367
There we go, so that's all lined up.

32
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:32,565
This looks pretty good so far.

33
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:36,438
So I need to create a field here for operating systems

34
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:39,938
and the appropriate getter setter methods.

35
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,985
And I'll go into Student.java.

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,316
I'll scroll down here and just add a new field

37
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,119
for operating systems, so private String,

38
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,207
operating systems.

39
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:55,181
Now, the important thing here is that,

40
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,575
again like I mentioned earlier,

41
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,700
they can select multiple operating systems,

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,661
so we need a collection.

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,457
In this case, we need to have an array of strings.

44
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,591
And then at the bottom here,

45
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,711
I'll generate my getter setter methods here

46
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,378
for that property or that field.

47
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,420
So, generate getters and setters.

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,587
Then I'll choose operating systems and I'll click OK.

49
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:29,706
Alright, so there we go, lines 67 through 73,

50
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,508
we have those getter and setter methods.

51
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:35,217
The setter methods is what Spring MVC will call

52
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:38,550
when they actually do a form submission.

53
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,914
Alrighty, so let's go ahead save that file.

54
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,263
Now, the one last thing we have to do is

55
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:49,627
just move over to our confirmation page and simply

56
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,071
display the operating systems that the user selected.

57
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,089
But it's going to be a little bit different now, right?

58
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:58,622
Because with the operating systems, they can have multiple.

59
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:01,863
So actually what we need to do is loop over

60
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:05,137
that array and print out the information.

61
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,454
So the first thing I need to do is

62
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:10,536
make use of the JSTL tags, the core tags,

63
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,696
that will give me that for each tag

64
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:15,210
for looping over a collection.

65
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,710
So I'll click that at the top.

66
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:23,604
And now down here, I'll just copy line 19 of the Rs,

67
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,065
paste them here, and I'm basically going to

68
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:29,604
loop over that array and then print out each item.

69
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:32,302
So I'll just make use of a bullet list

70
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:36,052
to display those different operating systems.

71
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,143
So the bullet list, I'll make use of UL, unordered list.

72
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:44,271
And then I'll give a collection of list items here

73
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:48,432
that you'll actually have for the given name.

74
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:52,599
So that's the basic layout there for doing a bullet list,

75
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,671
but I need to kind of add some code here

76
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,520
such that it will actually loop over it.

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,501
So I can add code by making use of JSTL,

78
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,501
so I use the c:forEach,

79
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,677
I give the variable equals temp,

80
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,017
so that's the variable name, and then the items.

81
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:10,100
So I'll say student.operatingSystems.

82
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:14,826
So that will basically call the getter method.

83
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,909
It'll say student.getOperatingSystems

84
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,151
and it will loop over that, get those values,

85
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,885
and we can kind of display them here.

86
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:26,134
So let me clean this up a bit.

87
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:29,014
Let's see, line 30, I actually want to use that

88
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:33,181
temporary variable that was passed in right there.

89
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,733
So, inside of here I want to say dollar sign temp,

90
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,851
so that will give me the temp variable.

91
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,173
It'll give me that element in the array

92
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,414
that I'm looping over right now.

93
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,210
So that's the basic coding there for kind of

94
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,207
looping over that array and displaying

95
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,174
the information on our confirmation page.

96
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,869
And here we're making use of the JSTL

97
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,536
to help us out with the looping.
