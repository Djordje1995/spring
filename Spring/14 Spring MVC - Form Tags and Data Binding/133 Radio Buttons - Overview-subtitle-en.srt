00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:06,344
Spring MVC Form Tags for radio buttons.

3
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:11,936
So here's a quick demo of radio buttons.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,058
We'll enter the user's information.

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:16,024
And then they can choose their

6
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:17,244
favorite programming language.

7
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,530
So radio button, they can only choose one option.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,179
They choose their one favorite language,

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,198
such as PHP in this example.

10
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:25,104
And then they can hit submit and then it will actually

11
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:29,616
show them the results on the confirmation page.

12
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,308
So their selected language there,

13
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:33,641
PHP, from that radio button.

14
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:38,617
Now, in the Spring MVC world, they have support

15
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,932
for radio buttons, and it's really simple here.

16
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:43,349
It's called form:radiobutton.

17
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,900
So let's look at a quick code example.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,293
This is really simple.

19
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,586
So here, I'm gonna have radio buttons

20
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,733
for the four languages: Java, C#, PHP and Ruby.

21
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,301
We simply say, form:radiobutton,

22
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,443
path="favoriteLanguage", value="Java".

23
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,030
And the path="favoriteLanguage",

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,477
that's basically the property that we're binding

25
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,246
this radio button to, and that's basically it.

26
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,435
So they get to choose one of these options

27
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,995
and then we submit and then during the submission,

28
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:14,582
they'll call student.setFavoriteLanguage.

29
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,692
So we'll need to have a setter method there

30
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:19,525
to hold or handle this submission.

31
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,695
All righty, so that's basically it.

32
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,303
So what we'll do is we'll move into the clips,

33
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:26,871
we'll kind of pull it all together,

34
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:28,815
we'll add radio buttons to our form,

35
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:31,897
and then we'll display the results on our confirmation page.

36
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,647
So I'll see ya in the next video.
