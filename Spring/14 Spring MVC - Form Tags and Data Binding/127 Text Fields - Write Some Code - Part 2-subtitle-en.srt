1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,733 line:15% 
<v Instructor>Alrighty, so our next step</v>

2
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:06,041 line:15% 
is that we actually need to create the HTML form.

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,074 line:15% 
That's gonna have our input fields and our submit button,

4
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,074 line:15% 
and all that good stuff.

5
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,205
So, let's go ahead and swing back over

6
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:19,947
to our project structure here.

7
00:00:19,947 --> 00:00:22,047
And let's go move into

8
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:23,199
yeah so we're gonna click this file,

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,476
called student form.

10
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,602
So, let's go into WebContent,

11
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,449
WEB-INF view.

12
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,199
Let's do a right click here and say New File.

13
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,213
Alrighty, so the name of the file

14
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:39,880
is student-form.jsp.

15
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:49,051
And then, we'll go ahead and click on the Finish button.

16
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:52,963
Okay, great so our very empty file right now.

17
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,402
Let's go ahead and take care of some of the,

18
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:57,035
actually, the important thing here is

19
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,801
taking care of taglib reference up top,

20
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,534
so make sure you end the taglib reference

21
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,080
like I have here on the screen.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,529
Make sure you get the uri exactly

23
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,811
like I have here on the screen

24
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:10,286
'cause that'll help resolve any problems that you may have.

25
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:11,911
So, once that's in place,

26
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,662
I always like to do a copy-paste on it,

27
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:14,875
but you can go ahead and type it in,

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,272
but make sure it matches here on the screen.

29
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:19,200
Now, let's go ahead and take care of some of our

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
HTML

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,559
infrastructure or basic stuff we have to do.

32
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,508
I'll set up the head and the title,

33
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:28,376
Student Registration Form.

34
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:29,798
I'll set up the body,

35
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,718
and that's kind of just the basic structure here

36
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,508
for our HTML page.

37
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,129
I'll stretch out here at the bottom.

38
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,118
Give me some white space just so I can kind of stretch out

39
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:39,951
and move around a bit.

40
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,839
Then, basically, what I'm gonna do here is actually

41
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,654
go through and start creating the form.

42
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:46,699
Alright, so use form:form.

43
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,038
Again, we're using the Spring MVC form tags,

44
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:52,220
the actual action of processForm.

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,925
And then, I'll get the modelAttribute=student.

46
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,517
Now, remember this modelAttribute is very important

47
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:01,841
because it must match what the actual code we used

48
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,367
in our controller.

49
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,918
So, in our controller, we gave the attribute name of student

50
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,050
in all lower case.

51
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,167
Same thing here for the form.

52
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,911
Those have to match up.

53
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
Okay, great.

54
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,502
So, now, let's go ahead and start cutting out the form,

55
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,485
basically just setting up

56
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,834
an input field here for first name.

57
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,667
I will say form:input,

58
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,735
and then, we'll give the path=firstName.

59
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,782
And again, first name's a property of the student class

60
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:39,062
because we have Getter Setter methods for first name.

61
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,610
I'll just do a little copy paste here.

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,017
I'll just kinda copy line 15

63
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:46,100
and I'll move down and I'll paste it.

64
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,169
Actually, I'll copy 15 through 17.

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,216
I'll paste it right here,

66
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:54,350
and I'll change this to Last name,

67
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,183
as the label,

68
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:58,999
and also, I'll change the input path to LastName.

69
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:02,435 line:15% 
And again, that's the actual property of the student class

70
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,602 line:15% 
for Getter Setter methods.

71
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:10,235
Alrighty, so this looks good so far.

72
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:14,905
Let's go ahead and add our input type for our submit button.

73
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,707
So, that's the actual button the user will click

74
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,598
to send the data over.

75
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,681
And now, that's in place.

76
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:24,409
So, this looks pretty good so far,

77
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,192 line:15% 
and it's some simple editing there,

78
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:27,673 line:15% 
as far as alignment,

79
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,640 line:15% 
but the important thing here is that when we load the form,

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,722 line:15% 
Spring MVC will call the Getter method,

81
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,877 line:15% 
so they'll call getFirstName, getLastName.

82
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,485 line:15% 
And a similar thing, when we submit the data,

83
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:42,805 line:15% 
Spring will call student.setFirstName, setLastName.

84
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,774 line:15% 
So, when they load, they call Gets.

85
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,133 line:15% 
When you submit, they call Sets.

86
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,284 line:15% 
Just remember that, remember that.

87
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,729 line:15% 
Alrighty, now let's go ahead and take care of step four,

88
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,130 line:15% 
creating the form processing code.

89
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,089 line:15% 
So, that's code that's back in our controller,

90
00:03:56,089 --> 00:04:00,856
so I'll move back over to our StudentController.java.

91
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:01,918
And I need to go through

92
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:05,085
and actually define a new method here.

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,869
So, I'll first start off with the RequestMapping,

94
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:12,768
here the actual path, and that's the same thing

95
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:13,882
that we had on the form.

96
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,177
So, /processForm,

97
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,260
and then actually go through

98
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,485
and actually define my method here.

99
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,497
So, I'll call it processForm.

100
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,423
Again, our method name can be anything.

101
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:27,103
The important thing is the annotation.

102
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,817
Now, I set up the process form.

103
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:33,107
I set up ModelAttribute, Student, theStudent,

104
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,154
and remember they're actually gonna bind that ModelAttribute

105
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:38,624
to the parameter being passed in.

106
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:42,791
Now, I still have to do a return on student-confirmation,

107
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,493
so remember this will actually send it over

108
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:48,858
to studentconfirmation.jsp.

109
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,221
And we saw all of this on the slides.

110
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,467
We're just kinda cutting it,

111
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,622
cutting the code ourselves,

112
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,092
just to make sure that we can get everything working.

113
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:59,259
I'll go ahead and fix the import here on ModelAttribute.

114
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,471 line:15% 
And also, just as a reminder here on that

115
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:06,843 line:15% 
@ModelAttribute, so when they send it over,

116
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:09,552 line:15% 
that form data is gonna populate this student object

117
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:10,773 line:15% 
and then we can access it.

118
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,305 line:15% 
So, on the form, they have the modelAttribute of student.

119
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,697 line:15% 
Here, on our code, we use the same name with the same case.

120
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:19,183 line:15% 
And Spring does all the work behind the scenes

121
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:21,743
of populating that student object with all the data.

122
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,270
So, there's no need for us to manually do a request

123
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,516
on Get parameters.

124
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,971
Spring will just push everything in there.

125
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,804
I love it.

126
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:33,121
That's the nice feature of using Spring MVC.

127
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,964
Alright, so we can go ahead and do my System.out.println.

128
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,267
I'm just gonna print out some of the data

129
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,922
that came in, just to make sure

130
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,924
that Spring actually did populate it.

131
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:40,891
(chuckles)

132
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:44,203
Make sure that it's doing its work, as it's advertised.

133
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:47,786
So, here, I'll say theStudent.getFirstName,

134
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:53,607
and then, I'll just drop down a line here.

135
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,936
Give myself a white space,

136
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,611
and then, I say, theStudent.getLastName.

137
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,728
So, again, I just want to prop the information

138
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,389
to the console,

139
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,452
just to make sure that the controller gets the data,

140
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,785
and they can make use of it accordingly.

141
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,384
Alright, so that's basically the code there

142
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,567
for processing the form data.

143
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,019
Looks really good so far.

144
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:16,852
Good job.
