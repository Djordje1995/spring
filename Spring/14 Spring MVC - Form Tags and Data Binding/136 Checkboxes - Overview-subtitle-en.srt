<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna cover</v>

2
00:00:02,726 --> 00:00:05,809
Spring MVC form tags for check boxes.

3
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:08,653
So, let's imagine the scenario

4
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:10,188
where we're gonna ask the student

5
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:13,040
"Hey, which Operating Systems do you have experience with?"

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,832
So, in this case they may not select only one,

7
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:18,288
they may have experience with multiple Operating Systems.

8
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:21,336
So, with check boxes you can check multiple items,

9
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:25,513
Linux, Mac or Windows, all three, one or two of 'em.

10
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:26,346
Very easy.

11
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:30,141
So, how do we do this with Spring MVC?

12
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:31,980
Well, a check box is represented using

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,408
the form:checkbox tag.

14
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:37,241
Very simple, very straightforward.

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,192
And you kind of get in the groove here.

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,158
Once you've seen one of the Spring form tags

17
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:44,063
you can kind of pick up how the others work.

18
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:46,377
So, here's an example here using check boxes.

19
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:48,824
You say, form:checkbox, you give the path

20
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:51,893
that we're gonna bind to, in this example operatingSystems,

21
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,720
and then the value equals Linux.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,790
And you can repeat that process for the other fields here

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,873
for Mac OS and for Microsoft Windows.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,670
So, the only difference here is

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,910
that for check boxes, they can choose more than one option.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,342
So, in your Java class,

27
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:11,872
you're gonna have more than just a single field.

28
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,275
You'll have a field that's actually a collection

29
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:18,897
so it can hold multiple input items from the user

30
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:21,384
and in the following videos we'll dive into Eclipse

31
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:25,551
and I'll show you how to actually write the code for that.
