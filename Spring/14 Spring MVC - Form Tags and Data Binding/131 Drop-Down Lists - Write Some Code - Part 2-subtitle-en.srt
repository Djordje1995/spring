1
00:00:01,546 --> 00:00:02,885
<v Narrator>Alrighty so that was a good example</v>

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:05,132
but what if we wanted to read the list of countries

3
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,055
from a Java class?

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,280
So instead of hard coding it,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,443
let's read it from a Java class.

6
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,666
So basically, the first thing that we wanna do

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,916
is define country options in the class.

8
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:21,609
So, for the country options we'll simply

9
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,279
set up a linked hash map which is effectively

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,941
a collection of named value pairs in an ordered fashion.

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,628
So we'll have the country options so we'll

12
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,545
have the value and an actual label.

13
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:37,693
So, here this is a linked hash map.

14
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:40,306
In my constructor what I can do is go ahead

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,791
and construct or create that country options

16
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,867
and then I'll populate it with data.

17
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,348
So, when our spring embassy application runs

18
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,678
they'll actually read information from this class

19
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:53,566
as for a list of options as opposed to using it

20
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,718
hardcoded in the actual JSP page.

21
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:58,058
Now this is a simple example.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,579
I'm simply placing it here in this file.

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,638
But, we could easily integrate this with reading

24
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:05,213
it from a file system, reading it from a database

25
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:06,800
or from a web service.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,245
But here we're just gonna keep it simple for right now.

27
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,689
So, here's our country options.

28
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,856
Linked hash map and just the normal constructor there.

29
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,115
And now I'm gonna populate the country options.

30
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,755
So, I'm gonna make use of the ISO country code

31
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,730
and the actual country itself.

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,234
So, BR that's the actual code or value

33
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,576
and then Brazil is the actual label,

34
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,732
what the user will see, alright?

35
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:33,107
So, let me kind of copy/paste this x number of times

36
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:37,336
and I'll do this for the other countries here in my demo.

37
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:39,669
So, I'll have FR for France.

38
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:44,461
And then I'll--

39
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,814
Ya know the ISO country code for Germany

40
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,814
which is DE for Germany.

41
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,872
And then the country code for India, IN

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,628
and then the actual country itself, India.

43
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:58,674
So again, when you make use of the hash map

44
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:02,529
the first value is the actual code or key

45
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:06,785
and the second value is the actual value or label

46
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,545
that the user will see.

47
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,977
So those aren't country options.

48
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,889
Now, all we need to do here is really just create

49
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:14,455
just a getter method such that

50
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,854
Spring mvc can read that information.

51
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:18,618
So I'll simply do a right click here.

52
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:22,785
I'll say source and I'll say generate getters and setters.

53
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:26,096
But in this example, we only need the getter method

54
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,930
so I'll simply expand country options

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,513
and choose get country options.

56
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,451
And then I'll hit okay.

57
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:40,948
So, right here on line 50 through 52 is get country options

58
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:42,396
so when we show the forms, spring mvc will actually

59
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,078
call this method to use this to actually populate

60
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,661
or generate the drop down list.

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,007
Alright so let's go back over to our form now.

62
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,354
We're gonna actually use this.

63
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:54,823
So, we're gonna update our form.

64
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,828
So, instead of hard coding the values

65
00:02:56,828 --> 00:03:01,811
here on the JSP page, we're gonna change this up a bit.

66
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,568
So here I'll say form:options.

67
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,864
Note the S there, plural.

68
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:08,359
And then I give items.

69
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,148
And so this is actually gonna be the actual method call

70
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:15,952
here for our country options.

71
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,995
So, here I'll say student.countryoptions.

72
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:20,253
That's the items and what they're

73
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,902
gonna use for populating it.

74
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,525
And so notice here, it's simply one in three

75
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,767
that country option's gonna return a list--

76
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:30,265
Sorry, a linked hash map of values

77
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,059
and it'll use it accordingly.

78
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,299
So that's basically it.

79
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,115
So when we have student.countryoptions,

80
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,518
it's actually gonna call student.getcountryoptions.

81
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,057
It's actually gonna use that getter method

82
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,863
that we just defined previously.

83
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,050
Alright so that's it there.

84
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,834
So, we can go ahead and save this file.

85
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,487
Just double check things look okay over here.

86
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,054
Yeah, let me get rid of the--

87
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,906
No, that's fine I'll keep that there.

88
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:53,788
So, that's good.

89
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,154
So, we're good to go here.

90
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:57,487
That looks fine.

91
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,845
I'm gonna add one more country here

92
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,907
just to make sure that we're getting new data.

93
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:09,204
Cause we have the same items here in the previous video.

94
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:12,133
Make sure that this is new data that we're retrieving here.

95
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,133
So, the U.S.

96
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,846
Alright, so that should be the last entry

97
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:19,263
that you see there in our drop down list.

98
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,937
Alrighty so let's go ahead and save that.

99
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:28,770
Let's go ahead and run this application again.

100
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:33,473
And go through our student form.

101
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,475
And I always like to hit the refresh button

102
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,207
here at the top just to make sure

103
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:42,027
we're getting the latest and greatest.

104
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,692
And hit my drop down list and boom.

105
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,186
I like it.

106
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,019
You see that?

107
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,712
United States as our last entry there.

108
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:52,072
So, we're reading all of our data from the Java class

109
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,521
and we're not hardcoding it in the JSP page.

110
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,629
Again, that Java class, we have the data listed there.

111
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,438
But again, that Java class could read it

112
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:02,256
from a database or a properties file

113
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,801
or some external service.

114
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,273
But, the key here now is that the JSP page

115
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,844
simply tells the class hey give me the options

116
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:12,460
and the class handles retrieving that data

117
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,100
and passing it back.

118
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,935
So, good job.

119
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,610
I hope this example was useful for you

120
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,750
and I hope you like it.

121
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,083
Alright, I'll see you in the next video.
