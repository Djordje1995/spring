1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,875
<v Instructor>Let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.</v>

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:06,180
We're gonna work through our development process

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,406
and we're gonna do everything step by step

4
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:10,528
and we'll build it all from scratch.

5
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:12,021
The first thing we're gonna work on

6
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,354
is step one, creating the Student class.

7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,584 line:15% 
What I'll do here is I'll move down

8
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:25,565 line:15% 
to my Java Resources directory,

9
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,130
to my source directory, to my package

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,297
and I'll do a right click and I'll say, New, Class.

11
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,850
The actual name that I'll give for this class,

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,600
I'll call it Student.

13
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,404
Real simple.

14
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:46,571
I'll keep all the other defaults and I'll hit Finish.

15
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,601
We have our basic class here.

16
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,979
I'll expand the window.

17
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,233
This Student is gonna have two fields.

18
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,816
It's gonna have a firstName and a lastName.

19
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:10,819
I've also set up a no argument constructor for our Student.

20
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,655
Now what I need to do is actually generate

21
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,748
some getter and setter methods for this Student.

22
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,989
Again, I'll make use of that Eclipse trick

23
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,865
where I'll simply just do a right click

24
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:27,032
and I'll go to Source, Generate Getters and Setters.

25
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,732
Eclipse will bring up the dialog.

26
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:38,364
I'll go ahead and check the box here

27
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,016
for firstName and lastName and that'll generate

28
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:43,515
getters and setters for both of those.

29
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,343
I'll go ahead and keep all the other defaults

30
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:46,676
and I'll hit OK.

31
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,751
Again, Eclipse does a lot of great work for us.

32
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:52,993
It generates all this great code for us.

33
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,547
So there you have it.

34
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,059
We have getFirstName, setFirstName

35
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:59,058
and getLastName, setLastName.

36
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:00,642
All right, we're good to go.

37
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:04,207
That's basically it for this Student class.

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,870 line:15% 
I can save this, move out.

39
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,135 line:15% 
Moving over to step two is creating

40
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,170 line:15% 
a Student controller class.

41
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,141 line:15% 
So that's our spring-mvc controller.

42
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,727
Again, I'll go to my package,

43
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:19,310
I'll do a right click, I'll say New, Class.

44
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:26,713
And again, as you'd expect,

45
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,046
the name here will be StudentController.

46
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,452
And then again, we'll keep all the other defaults

47
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:39,535
and then we'll hit the Finish button.

48
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,344
So here's our controller and this is where

49
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:46,746
we have to actually do our work.

50
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,047
Up top we set up some annotations.

51
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:52,523
We basically say it's @Controller.

52
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:55,889
And we also set up the RequestMapping for this one.

53
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,049
Everything's gonna be based off of /student.

54
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,966
Swing over here and fix the imports real quick.

55
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,230
The first thing we need to do is

56
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,397
actually create a method for actually showing our form.

57
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,871
So I'll go ahead and give the method name ShowForm.

58
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:32,038
It's gonna take the parameter from Mode, theModel.

59
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:38,261
And I'll just go ahead and do a

60
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:42,215
quick return to say return student-form.

61
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:46,116
That'll actually return it back to the student-form.jsp.

62
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:49,116
I'll fix the imports here for Model.

63
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:55,307
So we took care of all the dotting the I's

64
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:56,996
and crossing the T type stuff.

65
00:03:56,996 --> 00:04:00,287
I'll also set up the annotation up top for Request Mapping.

66
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,204
So this'll be /showForm.

67
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:07,327
On the inside of my Method I'll just write

68
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,583
some quick comments here to kind of keep myself on track

69
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,684
as far as what I actually need to do in this item.

70
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:15,128
Again, remember we're using forms here,

71
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:18,133
so we're gonna make use of a Model attribute.

72
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,718
The first thing I need to do here

73
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,301
is create a new student object.

74
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:28,887
And then I need to actually add that student object

75
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,637
as a Model attribute.

76
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:35,566
So I basically add it to the model.

77
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,882
So those are the comments there.

78
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,985
I have a good feel for what I need to do.

79
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,569
Let's go ahead and start cutting some code.

80
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,202
Creating the Student, we simply say

81
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:46,414
theStudent = new Student.

82
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:48,945
Again, very simple Java coding there.

83
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,649
Now we need to add this to the model,

84
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,482
so I'll say theModel.addAtrribute.

85
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,726 line:15% 
I'll give the actual name of the attribute

86
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,976 line:15% 
and the actual value for the attribute.

87
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,200 line:15% 
So we create the Student object

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,290 line:15% 
and then we add it as an attribute,

89
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,495 line:15% 
giving the name of Student and the value of theStudent.

90
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:17,245 line:15% 
That's the object that we created on line 15.

91
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,405
That's basically it here for this showForm

92
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,942
that we simply create our object,

93
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,696
add it to the model and then we simply

94
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,487
do a return over to student-form

95
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,298
and that'll pass it over to student-form.jsp.

96
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,215
This looks good so far.
