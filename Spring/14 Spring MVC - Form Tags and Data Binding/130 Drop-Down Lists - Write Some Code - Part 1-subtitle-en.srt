1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:02,052
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:04,735
and move into Eclipse, three steps here:

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:08,144
updating our HTML form, updating our student class

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,477
and also updating our confirmation page.

5
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:17,055
So, let's go ahead and start with Step One,

6
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:19,296
updating the HTML form.

7
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:20,934
So, I'll go into our View

8
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,848
and I'll find our student-form.jsp,

9
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:27,368
I'll double-click that file and open it up,

10
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:30,268
stretch it out and I'll move down here,

11
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:31,418
right below Last name,

12
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:35,467
I'm gonna add a new entry here for country

13
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,818
because I want to have a little drop-down list for country.

14
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:41,318
So, I'll just copy the br's there for a second

15
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:42,151
and I'll just zoom in.

16
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,245
I'll go ahead and enter the label here, Country,

17
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,162
and then I'll set up my form:select

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,325
and I'll set the path equals="country"

19
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,636
and then I'll do a /form:select.

20
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:00,803
All right, so that looks good, so far.

21
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:04,871
So, now, I need to give 'em some options

22
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,788
for the drop-down list, so I'll say form:option

23
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:14,081
and then I give value= and then I give label=

24
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:16,293
and for right now, I'll just make it an empty string.

25
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,343
I'm just gonna copy paste this x number of times,

26
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:21,781
'cause I, you know, I have a lot of coding here to do,

27
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,691
so, again, I'm being lazy.

28
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,102
So, I'll just copy paste that

29
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:27,232
and now I'll just go ahead and enter the values here

30
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,612
for the different countries.

31
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,653
So, I'll start with value for Brazil,

32
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,373
copy paste that for label and then I'll go ahead

33
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,696
and kind of speed the video up here for a second.

34
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,863
I'll do a similar thing for France, Germany and India.

35
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:47,161
All right, so there we go,

36
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,475
so we have this drop-down list set up

37
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,435
and the important thing here is

38
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,255
that when we actually do a submit,

39
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,338
Spring MVC is gonna call,

40
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:58,507
it's gonna call student.setCountry,

41
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,417
so we'll have to make sure

42
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:02,917
that our java object has support for that.

43
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:06,178
So, that's actually our next step here, Step Two.

44
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:10,570
We're going to add the property to the Student class.

45
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,629
So, I'll move over to,

46
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,510
over here to my Java source code, under Resources,

47
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,593
student.java, beam it up.

48
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,966
All right, so let's move into student.java.

49
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,934
We're going to add a new field,

50
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,264
so this is gonna be a field for Country, which is a String,

51
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:27,596
so I'll say private String country;

52
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,674
so that's the new field that we've added,

53
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,534
but now we need to expose it as a property

54
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,142
by using those getter setter methods.

55
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:36,255
So, let me kind of move down to the bottom of this file

56
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:38,926
and I make use of my right-click.

57
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,050
Then, I'll go to Source

58
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,550
and I'll say Generate Getters and Setters.

59
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,110
And, I'll kind of zoom in, here, and I'll chose country,

60
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,250
so that's the field

61
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,420
that we want to generate getters and setters for

62
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,503
and I'll kind of zoom out and hit OK.

63
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,224
All right, so there we go,

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,756
so we have our new methods here, getCountry, setCountry.

65
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:05,615
So, again, when they submit the data,

66
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:08,867
they're gonna call student.setCountry.

67
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,165
Okay, we're in good shape, here.

68
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:13,096
Now, Step Three is updating the confirmation page,

69
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:15,064
so, basically, once they've submitted their data,

70
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:18,094
we at least want to tell the user, "Hey, you selected X."

71
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:18,978
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead

72
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:21,958
and add a little linebreak here

73
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,177
and also I want to display the actual student.

74
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,927
So, stretch out a bit

75
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,697
and I'll say, Country,

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,608
and I'll say, :student.country

77
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:37,548
and, again, remember it's gonna call student.getCountry

78
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:40,068
'cause were using the jsp expression language

79
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:41,607
and that'll basically display

80
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,940
whatever the user selected on that form.

81
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,484
Alrighty, so this looks pretty good, so far.

82
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:50,845
Let's go ahead and test it out.

83
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,595
Let's run it, run it.

84
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:58,105
So, I'll just right-click, Run As, Run on Server

85
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:06,687
and there's our link to our form, select the link

86
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:11,453
and, now, we have our drop-down list.

87
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,914
Woo hoo, looks pretty, looks fancy, let's check it out.

88
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,900
Let's check it out.

89
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,072
So, I'll go ahead and enter the name John Doe

90
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:22,750
and then my drop-down list, Brazil, France, Germany, India.

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,704
Whew, I like it.

92
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:24,589
It looks good.

93
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,042
I'll choose Germany and I'll do a submit

94
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,740
and then there's our confirmation page.

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,393
Country, Germany, whatever the user selected on the form,

96
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,782
so this looks really good.

97
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:35,409
So, again, we made use of the Spring MVC form tag

98
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,942
for creating drop-down lists

99
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:41,109
and we read the data and put it on our confirmation page.
