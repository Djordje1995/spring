1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,569
In this video, we're going to learn how to make an integer field required.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,870
So far we've created this nice form, we've added some validation rules already.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,059
We have last name that's required, we have our free passes, we've also added pattern

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,150
matching to our postal code.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,150
What I'd like to do is actually make this free passes field required such that, if the

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
user doesn't provide a value, then we'll actually give them a error message saying, "Hey, this

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:32,330
given field is required."

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,330
All righty, let's go ahead and move into our coda, shouldn't be too hard right, 'cause

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,000
we've added required fields before.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's go ahead and move into our source directory, and let's open up customer.java, all right,

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,130
expand the window here.

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,191
Let's take a look, so yeah, so we've already added our required fields for last name, so

13
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:57,191
hopefully we can do something similar here for free passes.

14
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,949
For free passes here, we have our min, and our max value, and this is the field that

15
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,230
I want to make required.

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,230
Basically, I simply do a copy paste exercise, I'll copy the @NotNull from last name, and

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,890
I'll simply move down to my free passes field and paste it.

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,030
All right, so there we go, so we have this @NotNull that we've added here for our free

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,030
passes field.

20
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,240
This will basically make sure that's this given field is required.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,240
If they didn't provide a value, then we'll actually display the error message, is required.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,140
That's the game plan, we've kind of seen this before.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,250
All righty let's go ahead and test this out.

24
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,250
I'll save my file, move over here, and run my application, run as an run on server.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,420
I'll through and choose this link for customer form, and I'll test the field free passes

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,110
is required.

27
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,680
I'll give something for last name, for free passes, I'll empty this field out, make it

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,820
empty, make it blank.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,820
I'll go ahead and hit on the submit button here, and ugh, okay, what the what?

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,960
I get this long message here, it says, oh gosh, this is crazy, just double checking

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,400
something real quick here, let's empty out last name, and I hit submit.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,490
Okay, so last name is required, that part worked, but what's up with this guy?

33
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,910
Says, "Failed to convert property of string to required type."

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,650
Okay, so the root cause is it's a type conversion error.

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,850
Couldn't convert a string to the primitive type of int.

36
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,850
Ah, gosh.

37
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,800
A lot of stuff here.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,800
All right, let's go ahead and try and fix this, or resolve it.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,690
We can actually resolve this by refactoring our field.

40
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,470
Instead of using the primitive type, we can use the Integer type.

41
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,790
That's with a capital I, this is basically a wrapper class.

42
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,080
Why won't this work?

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Because, if our field is blank, or has spaces, then they'll actually trim it to null, using

44
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,340
that string trimmer editor that we've added before, and then this'll handle the appropriate

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
issue.

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Again, we're going from int to Integer, and Integer's a special wrapper class in java.

47
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,680
That's our field on line 22.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,180
We also have to update our getter and setter methods in this class.

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,640
Let's go ahead and scroll down to the bottom.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,640
For get free passes, we get the return type of Integer, with a capital I, and then we

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
have to do a similar thing here for our setter method, Integer with a capital I.

52
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,020
Again, we're basically using classes here, instead of the primitives here, and hopefully,

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,100
this should help us out with that validation as far as the type conversions from strings

54
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,370
to ints.

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,060
All right, let's go ahead and save all this stuff, move back over here, and let's run

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,060
our application one more time, and let's cross our fingers, hope it works.

57
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,090
We move in here to customer form.

58
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,390
Free passes, we'll leave it blank, we won't put any information in there, and we'll hit

59
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,170
submit, and boo-yah, oh yeah, just the way I wanted it.

60
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,750
Is required, so they can handle the nulls and all that stuff, and that's working out

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
just fine.

62
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,760
Let's just check it with last name.

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,760
We give a last name, we hit submit, and great, so is required is being applied to our free

64
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,970
passes field, so that's kind of working out as desired.

65
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,530
Give real values, it goes through, and the validation passes.

66
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh boy, woo.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,040
The key here was simply converting from an int to an Integer type, or refactoring from

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,380
int to Integer, and that helped us resolve this issue.

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,380
Great job, but we're not really, really done.

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,060
There is some other issues with this form, you may have discovered them, if not, we'll

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,070
actually talk about them in the next video.

72
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,540
Stay tuned.
