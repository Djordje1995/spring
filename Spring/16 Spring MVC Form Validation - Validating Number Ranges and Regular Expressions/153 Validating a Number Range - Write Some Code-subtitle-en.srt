1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:01,709
<v Darby>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,383 line:15% 
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:06,214 line:15% 
What we'll do here is we'll start with the first step here,

4
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:10,832 line:15% 
adding the validation rule to the customer class.

5
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,557
So let me go ahead and move into my source directory,

6
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:16,553
and let me find the Customer.java file,

7
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:20,393
and let's go ahead and double-click this one and open it up.

8
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:23,337
All right, now I'll go ahead and expand the window.

9
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:26,512
So, for this customer class, we need to add a new field,

10
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,769
and that field name is called freePasses,

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,453
and it's an integer.

12
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:33,370
So I'll say private int freePasses.

13
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,025
All-righty, so this looks good so far.

14
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:39,373
Now the next thing I need to do is actually generate

15
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,788
the getters and setters for this field.

16
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,014
So what I'll do here is I'll simply just move to the bottom

17
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,716
of the file, and I'll just do right-click

18
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:49,466
and I'll choose Source, and here,

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,391
Generate Getters and Setters.

20
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,224
Yep.

21
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:59,266
Then I'll select the one item here for freePasses,

22
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:02,183
I check the box, and then hit okay.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,023
All right, great.

24
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,733
So on lines 32 through 38, those are the new methods

25
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,118
that Eclipse has generated for us,

26
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:11,695
those getters and setters.

27
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,083
All right, so this is good stuff.

28
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,551
Let's go ahead and move back to the top of this file,

29
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,683
and let's add some validation rules.

30
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:21,649 line:15% 
All right, so we have our field on line 15 right now,

31
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,210 line:15% 
private int freePasses.

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,615 line:15% 
I'm gonna add the validation rules for @Min,

33
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,437 line:15% 
and also @Max.

34
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,987 line:15% 
So starting with @Min, I'll say the minimum value

35
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,364 line:15% 
for this field is zero, and then I get

36
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:35,066 line:15% 
the actual error message that'll be thrown or generated

37
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:37,566 line:15% 
in case this validation fails.

38
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,903
And for the error message, you can give anything you want.

39
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,295
Here, I'm just kinda keeping it simple for right now.

40
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,225
So, that's @Min right now.

41
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:49,520
I'll just copy-paste that,

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,013
and I'll do a similar thing for @Max.

43
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:54,147
So the maximum value, just based on these rules we're

44
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,601
setting up, the maximum value is 10, and again, you can give

45
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,254
any values you want here, but just to kinda follow

46
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,728
with the example I've created so far.

47
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,895
So here the value must be less than or equal to 10.

48
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,030
All-righty, that looks good.

49
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,839
So let's go ahead and fix the imports here, so fix

50
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:17,006
the import for @Min, and also fix the import for @Max.

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,594
All-righty, that looks good, and let's see.

52
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,654
I have a little typo here on this line.

53
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,216
I don't need semicolons there.

54
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,266
I don't know why I did that.

55
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,458
That was bad.

56
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,714
So I'll get rid of that semicolon and that semicolon.

57
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:34,547
Okay, good.

58
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:35,818
So, good stuff here.

59
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,378
So now we have this field created,

60
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,925
and we have our validation rules for @Min and @Max.

61
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,425
This is very simple, very straightforward.

62
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,803
Okay, so now, what we need to do next

63
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,269
is actually move to step two, and that's displaying

64
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,439
the error message on the HTML form.

65
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,342
So I'll go into my view directory,

66
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,350
and I'll go to customer-form.jsp,

67
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,350
and I'll open that file.

68
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:09,163
And I'll expand the window here for a second.

69
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,347
So again, basically I'm just gonna define a form field

70
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:12,773
and also the form errors.

71
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:16,380
So, I'll just copy-paste the line breaks there,

72
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,946
and I'm just gonna add a new entry here for Free passes,

73
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:24,244
and then actually give a form, colon, input,

74
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:27,252
and I map that to freePasses.

75
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:31,419
That's the field that we just created in our customer class.

76
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,849
And on line 29, I'll also give information here

77
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,692
for form:errors, so path="freePasses,"

78
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,087
then also specify the cssClass.

79
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,724
Just in the event that, hey, the validation fails, then the

80
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,891
error message for this field will appear just next to it.

81
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,072
And now that's basically it.

82
00:03:52,072 --> 00:03:54,284
So this is really just a repeat of what we've done so far

83
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,816
for Last name.

84
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:58,816
A similar thing here for freePasses.

85
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,275
All-righty.

86
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,627
Now the next step in our process

87
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:09,794 line:15% 
is actually performing the validation in the controller.

88
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,388 line:15% 
So that's step three,

89
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,363 line:15% 
perform validation in the controller.

90
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:17,097 line:15% 
Now, one little caveat here is that there is nothing

91
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,073 line:15% 
that we really have to do here.

92
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:20,792 line:15% 
The code that we already have in our

93
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,399 line:15% 
CustomerController.java, we can use the exact same code.

94
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,986 line:15% 
There's no changes, no modifications needed here,

95
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:31,375 line:15% 
because we have the @Valid attribute on line 25,

96
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,727 line:15% 
and that's already working for Last name.

97
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,714 line:15% 
So there's nothing new we need to do.

98
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:39,116 line:15% 
I'm simply showing you this file here and then showing you

99
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:42,039 line:15% 
this step just out of completeness, but again,

100
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,404 line:15% 
no changes, no code needed for our controller.

101
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,904 line:15% 
We can kinda leave that as is.

102
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,105
So, next, what we'll do here is we'll cover step four,

103
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:55,879
and that's updating our confirmation page.

104
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,457
So what we'll do here is move back into our view,

105
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:02,374
and then we'll go to customer-confirmation.jsp.

106
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,968
And basically what we wanna do here is just give an output,

107
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,553
just echo whatever they entered

108
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,708
for the value for the free passes.

109
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,235
So here, I'll just put in a little &lt;br&gt; there,

110
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:15,315
and then I'll just say Free passes,

111
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,216
and I'll just drop in the value of Free passes.

112
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:20,578
So again, using my JSP extression language,

113
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:24,133
I'll say customer.freePasses, and whatever the user entered,

114
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:27,016
it'll be echoed here on the screen.

115
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:30,073
Very simple, very straightforward.

116
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:31,913
There's no rocket science here.

117
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:34,663
We've seen all this stuff before.

118
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,681
All-righty, so we're at a point when we can actually run

119
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:41,507
our application, so let's just move back over to our app,

120
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,590
just do a right-click, Run As, and Run on Server.

121
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,179
Okay, great, our app is up and running.

122
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,929
We hit Customer form.

123
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,750
And then we'll just enter the fields here

124
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,010 line:15% 
for First name, Last name, and then for Free passes,

125
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,217 line:15% 
let's add some bad data.

126
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,754 line:15% 
Right, we're trying to break the system.

127
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,637 line:15% 
So, a large value of 555,

128
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,643 line:15% 
it says must be less than or equal to 10.

129
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:07,476 line:15% 
Okay, great.

130
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,910 line:15% 
Let's try a negative value.

131
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,999 line:15% 
Hit submit.

132
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,723 line:15% 
Again, must be greater than or equal to zero,

133
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,350 line:15% 
and then we can hit a value of four,

134
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,802 line:15% 
which is in that range, so it's good.

135
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,590 line:15% 
So, as we can see, our validation rules

136
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,296 line:15% 
are working as expected.

137
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,218 line:15% 
It only accepts values between the range of zero and 10.

138
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,670 line:15% 
So I'd say good job with adding validation ranges

139
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,665
with spring and receive.

140
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:30,498
Woohoo!
