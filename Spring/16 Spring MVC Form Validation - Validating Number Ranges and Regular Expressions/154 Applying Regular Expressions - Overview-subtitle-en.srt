00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:03,073
<v Darby>In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:03,073 --> 00:00:07,240
about Spring MVC Validation, with Regular Expressions.

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,888
So a regular expression is just a sequence

4
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,340
of characters that define a search pattern.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,178
You can use this pattern of find or match strings

6
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,764
but you can also use it for validation.

7
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:22,765
Now, Regular Expressions it's like its own language.

8
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:25,182
This is really an advanced topic,

9
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:27,248
so I'm gonna assume you already know about

10
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:29,042
Regular Expressions and I'll simply

11
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:31,957
show you how to apply it with Spring MVC.

12
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:33,739
Now, if you don't have any experience

13
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:34,917
with Regular Expressions there's plenty

14
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:36,753
of free tutorials available.

15
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:40,420
Check the link here, available on this line.

16
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,385
So what we'll do is we'll actually

17
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:46,784
use Regular Expressions to validate a postal code.

18
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,765
So our form will have a new field for postal code.

19
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:53,810
And the user can only enter five characters or digits

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,097
in order to pass validation.

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,734
And again, we'll actually apply

22
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:01,901
a pattern for Regular Expressions for this validation.

23
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,824
Now let's look at the development process very similar.

24
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:09,631
We'll simply add a validation rule

25
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:11,411
to the customer class.

26
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,061
Then we'll display the error messages

27
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,661
on the HTML form.

28
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,835
And finally, we'll update the confirmation page.

29
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:18,755
So this is all very similar to what

30
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:22,922
we've seen before, in some of the previous videos.

31
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:26,713
All righty, so adding the validation rule

32
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,430
to the customer class.

33
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,316
So basically what we do is make use of a pattern.

34
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:33,512
And then we have regex, that's Regular Expression.

35
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,058
And we simply, drop in that regular expression.

36
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:38,425
So what you see there in blue

37
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:39,934
that's the actual regular expression

38
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,859
that will only match on five characters and digits.

39
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,006
Now, I know the expression looks a little bit scary,

40
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,732
a little bit cryptic, but that's kind of

41
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,813
the language of Regular Expressions.

42
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,682
So once you know Regular Expressions.

43
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:53,182
You can simply drop in your appropriate expression

44
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,974
and you're ready to go.

45
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:57,250
So, again, here we have the Regular Expression

46
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,770
and then we have the actual error message.

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,879
We simply apply this pattern, to a field,

48
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,449
for a postal code.

49
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:04,921
And that's it, and we create our normal

50
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,441
getters and setters, and then we're up and running.

51
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,274
And we're ready to go.

52
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,071
And that's it for step one.

53
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,618
We'll cover steps two and three in the next video,

54
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,424
once we move into Eclipse.

55
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:19,174
So I'll see ya in the next video.
