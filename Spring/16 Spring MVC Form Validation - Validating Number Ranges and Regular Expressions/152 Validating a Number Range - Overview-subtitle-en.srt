<v ->In this video, we're gonna learn about</v>

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:06,025
Spring MVC Validation for number ranges,

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,692
using @Min and @Max.

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:15,032
So what we'll do here is we will actually add a new field

5
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:18,150
to our HTML form for free passes.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,865
So this Free Passes field, the user will be able to

7
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:24,522
enter a value between zero and 10.

8
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:26,246
And that's our number range.

9
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:28,669
Anything outside of that range then, we should have

10
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:32,886
a validation error displayed on the screen.

11
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:34,900
So let's look at the development process, and we've

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,484
kinda seen this before.

13
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,687
But with step one we'll add the validation rule

14
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:41,816
the the Customer class, and then from there we'll

15
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:44,796
display the error message on the HTML form.

16
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:47,499
Then next we'll actually perform the validation in

17
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:50,452
the Controller class, and then finally, we'll update

18
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:54,899
our confirmation page with the appropriate information.

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,512
Alrighty so let's dive in and take a look at step one,

20
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:00,374
adding the validation rule to the Customer class.

21
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:02,433
So basically what we're gonna do here is have this

22
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:06,044
new field in our Customer class called Free Passes.

23
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,368
So I'll define it as private int freePasses.

24
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:12,075
And now, what I'd like to do is actually make use of

25
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:16,244
two new annotations to set up our validation rules.

26
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,947
I'll make use of an @Min and an @Max.

27
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,077
Very self-explanatory, right?

28
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:25,523
So @Min, value equals zero, that's the minimum value

29
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,742
that we'll expect, or accept, and then the

30
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:30,663
message equals, that's the actual error message

31
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:33,792
that's generated if this validation fails.

32
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,020
So that's for @Min.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,929
Then we'll also add one for @Max.

34
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,075
So the maximum value is 10, and then the appropriate

35
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,888
error message in case this validation fails.

36
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:46,836
So we've actually placed two annotations here,

37
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:50,777
on this given field, for a given range.

38
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,533
Now, we go through an do our normal work of adding the

39
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,435
getter and setter methods, so we can actually retrieve

40
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:59,240
the value for the free passes and also set the

41
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,182
value for the free passes.

42
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:04,053
But that's basically it as far as the coding here,

43
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,421
for the Customer class.

44
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,237
Alrighty so just a recap on the development process.

45
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,903
The first thing is adding the validation rule

46
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,108
to the Customer class, we just covered that.

47
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,425
Now steps two through four, I won't go through these

48
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,540
in the slides.

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,883
I'll actually save these, and we'll actually cover this

50
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:23,347
in the actual video because, steps two through four,

51
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:25,838
they're really similar to what we've already done before,

52
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:28,336
so there's really nothing new to cover in the slides.

53
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,323
We'll simply code this in Eclipse as we

54
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,593
go through the video.

55
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:34,343
So I'll see ya in the next video.
