1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,650
<v Instructor>Alright, let's go ahead and write some code.</v>

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,807
So we're gonna follow our development process here.

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:10,684
Define init and destroy methods and add the annotations.

4
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:12,233 line:15% 
Alright, so the first thing we need to do is

5
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,921 line:15% 
change the scope on tennis coach.

6
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,480 line:15% 
In the previous videos, we were playing around

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,457 line:15% 
with the scope and then we had scopes at the prototype.

8
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:22,358 line:15% 
I actually wanna remove the prototype scope.

9
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:24,665 line:15% 
I wanna just go back to using our default scope

10
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,356 line:15% 
which is singleton scope.

11
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:30,628 line:15% 
Alright, so I remove that, save this file.

12
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:32,076
And now what I'd like to do is go through

13
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:34,693 line:15% 
and actually define our init and destroy methods,

14
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:37,058 line:15% 
and actually set up the annotations for them.

15
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:38,109
So first off I'll just go ahead

16
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,939
and write some comments to myself

17
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,856
just so I can keep myself on track.

18
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,331
Alright, so my comments are in place.

19
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:47,719
Alright, so let's go ahead and dig in

20
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,552
and let's start writing some code.

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,574
I'll start right here with my init method

22
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:59,267
and I'll call it do my start up stuff

23
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,894
and inside I'll simply just do a print line

24
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:03,629
just so I know that Spring's actually

25
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,711
call init's method and doing something.

26
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:09,088
So here I'll just put tennis coach,

27
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:13,750
and then I'll say inside, do my start up stuff.

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,712
(writing some code...) 

29
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:18,045
(writing some code...) 

30
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,859
And that's the method and add my annotation,

31
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,178
whoops I almost forgot.

32
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,879
So here I'll say @postconstruct.

33
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,041
Just to let Spring know that

34
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,560 line:15% 
hey call this one once you construct the object.

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,810 line:15% 
I'll go ahead and fix the imports here.

36
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,830 line:15% 
And that looks OK, so let me just step back

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,916 line:15% 
and admire my beautiful work and yeah, looks good.

38
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,333 line:15% 
Looks good to me.

39
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,436
Well, let's go ahead and move on down and let's just

40
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:54,971
repeat the process here for our destroy method.

41
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,548
So again, we can give it any method name

42
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:59,489
so I'll call it do my clean up stuff.

43
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,406
And again, I'll do my system out print line,

44
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:04,776
and I'll simply print out what's happening inside of my

45
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,859
do clean up stuff method.

46
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:13,309
Make sure I add the annotation here.

47
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,734
So I'll say @predestroy,

48
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,066
and again you'll be able to fix the imports.

49
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:21,107
And basically there's my destroy method

50
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,599
along with the appropriate annotation.

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,099
Looks pretty good.

52
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,776 line:15% 
Well, I think my work is done here

53
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,268 line:15% 
right now on tennis coach.

54
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:34,241 line:15% 
Let's go ahead and move back over to

55
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:37,324 line:15% 
our main program annotation demo app.

56
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,570 line:15% 
So I'm in annotation demo app.

57
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,408
Again, this is our same main program that we've used before.

58
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:46,741
No changes here.

59
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,997
And I'll simply just do a right click and run it.

60
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:53,664
Run this baby. Run this program.

61
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,520
So our program's running now.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,159
We can go take a look at some of the output.

63
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,924
So here inside default constructor, that's good.

64
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:07,099
And, oh yeah! Inside of do my start up stuff.

65
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,605
Yeah, that's the @postconstruct word, I like that.

66
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,826
Very good, very good.

67
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,291
And then finally here,

68
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,262
inside of do my clean up stuff, so that's @predestroy,

69
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,532
so our custom hooks are in place.

70
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,461
They're executing as desired and I think we're good to go.

71
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,786
So we add some annotations here

72
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:27,901
to handle bean life-cycle methods.

73
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:30,068
Congratulations. Good job!
