<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:06,448
about bean lifecycle methods with annotations.

3
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,727
So remember in Spring, you can actually add some custom code

4
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,927
that will execute during bean initialization,

5
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:19,094
but you can also add code to run during bean destruction.

6
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:23,167
And the very basic development process here

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,399
that you simply define your methods

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,953
for initialization and destroy

9
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:31,439
and then all you do is you add annotations to those method

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,240
and the annotation that you'll use

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,073
is @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.

12
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,686
So, for initialization, you can choose

13
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:44,598
any method that you want, give it any method name,

14
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,742
and you simply annotate it with @PostConstruct.

15
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,038
So, as the annotation says, this code will execute

16
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:52,638
after the bean has been constructed.

17
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,054
So, this is where you can place your own

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,304
custom initialization work.

19
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,582
And likewise, you can actually write

20
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:02,381
some custom code here for destroy.

21
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:03,848
So, before your bean is destroyed

22
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,990
you can annotate a method with @PreDestroy

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,851
and then you can write your own

24
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,847
custom clean-up code to execute.

25
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:11,750
And that's pretty much it.

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,583
Very simple, very straightforward.
